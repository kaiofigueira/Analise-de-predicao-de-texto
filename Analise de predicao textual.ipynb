      "But this lone Qul-En was seeking a complex hormone substance which\r\n",
      "Qul-En medical science said theoretically must exist, but the molecule\r\n",
      "of which even the Qul-En could not synthesize directly. Yet it had to\r\n",
      "be found, in great quantity; once discovered, the problem of obtaining\r\n",
      "it would be taken up, with the resources of the whole race behind it.\r\n",
      "But first it had to be found.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tiny ship assigned to explore the Solar System for the hormone\r\n",
      "wished to pass unnoticed. Its mission of discovery should be\r\n",
      "accomplished in secrecy if possible. For one thing, the desired hormone\r\n",
      "would be destroyed by contact with the typical Qul-En ray-gun beam, so\r\n",
      "that normal methods of securing zoological specimens could not be used.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ship winked into being in empty space, not far from Neptune. It\r\n",
      "drove for that chilly planet, hovered about it, and decided not to\r\n",
      "land. It sped inward toward the sun and touched briefly on Io, but\r\n",
      "found no life there. It dropped into the atmosphere of Mars, and did\r\n",
      "not rise again for a full week, but the vegetation on Mars is thin and\r\n",
      "the animals mere degenerate survivors of once specialized forms. The\r\n",
      "ship came to Earth, hovered lightly at the atmosphere's very edge for\r\n",
      "a long time, and doubtless chose its point of descent for reasons that\r\n",
      "seemed good to its occupant. Then it landed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It actually touched Earth at night. There was no rocket-drive to call\r\n",
      "attention and by dawn it was well-concealed. Only one living creature\r\n",
      "had seen it land--a mountain-lion. Even so, by midday the skeleton of\r\n",
      "the lion was picked clean by buzzards, with ants tidying up after them.\r\n",
      "And the Qul-En in the ship was enormously pleased. The carcass, before\r\n",
      "being abandoned to the buzzards, had been studied with an incredible\r\n",
      "competence. The lion's nervous system--particularly the mass of tissue\r\n",
      "in the skull--unquestionably contained either the desired hormone\r\n",
      "itself, or something so close to it that it could be modified and the\r\n",
      "hormone produced. It remained only to discover how large a supply of\r\n",
      "the precious material could be found on earth. It was not feasible\r\n",
      "to destroy a group of animals--say, of the local civilized race--and\r\n",
      "examine their bodies, because the hormone would be broken down by the\r\n",
      "weapon which allowed of a search for it. So an estimate of available\r\n",
      "sources would have to be made by sampling. The Qul-En in the ship\r\n",
      "prepared to take samples.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ship had landed in tumbled country some forty miles south of\r\n",
      "Ensenada Springs, national forest territory, on which grazing-rights\r\n",
      "were allotted to sheep-ranchers after illimitable red tape. Within ten\r\n",
      "miles of the hidden ship there were rabbits, birds, deer, coyotes, a\r\n",
      "lobo wolf or two, assorted chipmunks, field-mice, perhaps as many as\r\n",
      "three or four mountain-lions, one flock of two thousand sheep, one man,\r\n",
      "and one dog.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man was Antonio Menendez. He was ancient, unwashed, and ignorant,\r\n",
      "and the official shepherd of the sheep. The dog was Salazar, of dubious\r\n",
      "ancestry but sound worth, who actually took care of the sheep and\r\n",
      "knew it; he was scarred from battles done in their defense. He was\r\n",
      "unweariedly solicitous of the wooly half-wits in his charge. There were\r\n",
      "whole hours when he could not find time to scratch himself, because of\r\n",
      "his duties. He was reasonably fond of Antonio, but knew that the man\r\n",
      "did not really understand sheep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Besides these creatures, among whom the Qul-En expected to find its\r\n",
      "samples, there were insects. These, however, the tiny alien being\r\n",
      "disregarded. It would not be practical to get any great quantity of the\r\n",
      "substance it sought from such small organisms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By nightfall of the day after its landing, the door of the ship\r\n",
      "opened and the explorer came out in a vehicle designed expressly for\r\n",
      "sampling on this planet. The vehicle came out, stood on its hind legs,\r\n",
      "closed the door, and piled brush back to hide it. Then it moved away\r\n",
      "with the easy, feline gait of a mountain-lion. At a distance of two\r\n",
      "feet it was a mountain-lion. It was a magnificent job of adapting\r\n",
      "Qul-En engineering to the production of a device which would carry a\r\n",
      "small-bodied explorer about a strange world without causing remark.\r\n",
      "The explorer nested in a small cabin occupying the space--in the\r\n",
      "facsimile lion--that had been occupied by the real lion's lungs. The\r\n",
      "fur of the duplicate was convincing; its eyes were excellent, housing\r\n",
      "scanning-cells which could make use of anything from ultraviolet far\r\n",
      "down into the infra-red. Its claws were retractable and of plastic\r\n",
      "much stronger and keener than the original lion's claws. It had\r\n",
      "other equipment, including a weapon against which nothing on this\r\n",
      "planet could stand, and for zoological sampling it had one remarkable\r\n",
      "advantage. It had no animal smell; it was all metal and plastics.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the first night of its roaming, nothing in particular happened. The\r\n",
      "explorer became completely familiar with the way the controls of the\r\n",
      "machine worked. As a machine, of course, it was vastly more powerful\r\n",
      "than an animal. It could make leaps no mere creature of flesh and\r\n",
      "blood could duplicate; its balancing devices were admirable; it was,\r\n",
      "naturally, immune to fatigue. The Qul-En inside it was pleased with the\r\n",
      "job.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That night Antonio and Salazar bedded down their sheep in a natural\r\n",
      "amphitheatre and Antonio slept heavily, snoring. He was a highly\r\n",
      "superstitious ancient, so he wore various charms of a quasi-religious\r\n",
      "nature. Salazar merely turned around three times and went to sleep.\r\n",
      "But while the man slept soundly, Salazar woke often. Once he waked\r\n",
      "sharply at a startled squawking among the lambs. He got up and trotted\r\n",
      "over to make sure that everything was all right, sniffed the air\r\n",
      "suspiciously. Then he went back, scratched where a flea had bitten\r\n",
      "him, bit--nibbling--at a place his paws could not reach, and went\r\n",
      "back to sleep. At midnight he made a clear circle around his flock\r\n",
      "and went back to slumber with satisfaction. Toward dawn he raised his\r\n",
      "head suspiciously at the sound of a coyote's howl, but the howl was\r\n",
      "far away. Salazar dozed until daybreak, when he rose, shook himself,\r\n",
      "stretched himself elaborately, scratched thoroughly, and was ready for\r\n",
      "a new day. The man waked, wheezing, and cooked breakfast; it appeared\r\n",
      "that the normal order of things would go undisturbed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a time it did; there was certainly no disturbance at the ship. The\r\n",
      "small silvery vessel was safely hidden. There was a tiny, flickering\r\n",
      "light inside--the size of a pin-point--which wavered and changed color\r\n",
      "constantly where a sort of tape unrolled before it. It was a recording\r\n",
      "device, making note of everything the roaming pseudo-mountain-lion's\r\n",
      "eyes saw and everything its micro-phonic ears listened to. There was\r\n",
      "a bank of air-purifying chemical which proceeded to regenerate itself\r\n",
      "by means of air entering through a small ventilating slot. It got rid\r\n",
      "of carbon dioxide and stored up oxygen in its place, in readiness for\r\n",
      "further voyaging.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course, ants explored the whole outside of the space-vessel, and\r\n",
      "some went inside through the ventilator-opening. They began to cart\r\n",
      "off some interesting if novel foodstuff they found within. Some very\r\n",
      "tiny beetles came exploring, and one variety found the air-purifying\r\n",
      "chemical refreshing. Numbers of that sort of beetle moved in and began\r\n",
      "to raise large families. A minuscule moth, too, dropped eggs lavishly\r\n",
      "in the nest-like space in which the Qul-En explorer normally reposed\r\n",
      "during space-flight. But nothing really happened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not until late morning. It was two hours after breakfast-time\r\n",
      "when Salazar found traces of the mountain-lion which was not a\r\n",
      "mountain-lion. He found a rabbit that had been killed. Having been\r\n",
      "killed, it had very carefully been opened up, its various internal\r\n",
      "organs spread out for examination, and its nervous system traced in\r\n",
      "detail. Its brain-tissue, particularly, had been most painstakingly\r\n",
      "dissected, so the amount of a certain complex hormone to be found in it\r\n",
      "could be calculated with precision. The Qul-En in the lion shape had\r\n",
      "been vastly pleased to find the sought-for hormone in another animal\r\n",
      "besides a mountain-lion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dissection job was a perfect anatomical demonstration; no\r\n",
      "instructor in anatomy could have done better, and few neuro-surgeons\r\n",
      "could have done as well with the brain. It was, in fact, a perfect\r\n",
      "laboratory job done on a flat rock in the middle of a sheep-range,\r\n",
      "and duly reproduced on tape by a flickering, color-changing light. The\r\n",
      "reproduction, however, was not as good as it should have been, because\r\n",
      "the tape was then covered by small ants who had found its coating\r\n",
      "palatable and were trying to clean it off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Salazar saw the rabbit. There were blow-flies buzzing about it, and a\r\n",
      "buzzard was reluctantly flying away because of his approach. Salazar\r\n",
      "barked at the buzzard. Antonio heard the barking; he came.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Antonio was ancient, superstitious, and unwashed. He came wheezing,\r\n",
      "accompanied by flies who had not finished breakfasting on the bits\r\n",
      "of his morning meal he had dropped on his vest. Salazar wagged his\r\n",
      "tail and barked at the buzzard. The rabbit had been neatly dissected,\r\n",
      "but not eaten. The cuts which opened it up were those of a knife or\r\n",
      "scalpel. It was not--it was definitely not!--the work of an animal.\r\n",
      "But there were mountain-lion tracks, and nothing else. More, every one\r\n",
      "of the tracks was that of a hind foot! A true mountain-lion eats what\r\n",
      "he catches; he does not stand on his hind paws and dissect it with\r\n",
      "scientific precision. Nothing earthly had done this!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Antonio's eyes bulged out. He thought instantly of magic, Black Magic.\r\n",
      "He could not imagine dissection in the spirit of scientific inquiry;\r\n",
      "to him, anything that killed and then acted in this fashion could only\r\n",
      "come from the devil.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gasped and fled, squawking. When he had run a good hundred yards,\r\n",
      "Salazar caught up to him, very much astonished. He overtook his master\r\n",
      "and went on ahead to see what had scared the man so. He made casts to\r\n",
      "right and left, then went in a conscientious circle all around the\r\n",
      "flock under his care. Presently he came back to Antonio, his tongue\r\n",
      "lolling out, to assure him that everything was all right. But Antonio\r\n",
      "was packing, with shaking hands and a sweat-streaked brow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In no case is the neighborhood of a mountain-lion desirable for a man\r\n",
      "with a flock of sheep. But this was no ordinary mountain-lion. Why,\r\n",
      "Salazar--honest, stout-hearted Salazar--did not scent a mountain-lion\r\n",
      "in those tracks. He would have mentioned it vociferously if he had, so\r\n",
      "this was beyond nature. The lion was _un fantasmo_ or worse; Antonio's\r\n",
      "thoughts ran to were-tigers, ghost-lions, and sheer Indian devils. He\r\n",
      "packed, while Salazar scratched fleas and wondered what was the matter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They got the flock on the move. The sheep made idiotic efforts to\r\n",
      "disperse and feed placidly where they were. Salazar rounded them up and\r\n",
      "drove them on. It was hard work, but even Antonio helped in frantic\r\n",
      "energy--which was unusual.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "                                   2\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Near noon, four miles from their former grazing-ground, there were\r\n",
      "mountain-peaks all around them. Some were snow-capped, and there were\r\n",
      "vistas of illimitable distance everywhere. It was very beautiful\r\n",
      "indeed, but Antonio did not notice; Salazar came upon buzzards again.\r\n",
      "He chased them with loud barkings from the meal they reluctantly\r\n",
      "shared with blow-flies and ants. This time it wasn't a rabbit; it\r\n",
      "was a coyote. It had been killed and most painstakingly taken apart\r\n",
      "to provide at a glance all significant information about the genus\r\n",
      "_canis_, species _latrans_, in the person of an adult male coyote. It\r\n",
      "was a most enlightening exhibit; it proved conclusively that there was\r\n",
      "a third type of animal, structurally different from both mountain-lions\r\n",
      "and rabbits, which had the same general type of nervous system, with a\r\n",
      "mass of nerve-tissue in one large mass in a skull, which nerve-tissue\r\n",
      "contained the same high percentage of the desired hormone as the\r\n",
      "previous specimens. Had it been recorded by a tiny colored flame in the\r\n",
      "hidden ship--the flame was now being much admired by small red bugs\r\n",
      "and tiny spiders--it would have been proof that the Qul-En would find\r\n",
      "ample supplies on Earth of the complex hormone on which the welfare of\r\n",
      "their race now depended. Some members of the Qul-En race, indeed, would\r\n",
      "have looked no farther. But sampling which involved only three separate\r\n",
      "species and gave no proof of their frequency was not quite enough;\r\n",
      "the being in the synthetic mountain-lion was off in search of further\r\n",
      "evidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Antonio was hardly equipped to guess at anything of this sort. Salazar\r\n",
      "led him to the coyote carcass; it had been neatly halved down the\r\n",
      "breast-bone. One-half the carcass had been left intact; the other half\r\n",
      "was completely anatomized, and the brain had been beautifully dissected\r\n",
      "and spread out for measurement. Antonio realized that intelligence had\r\n",
      "been at work. But--again--he saw only the pad-tracks of a mountain\r\n",
      "lion, and he was literally paralyzed by horror.\r\n",

      "matter the returning explorer was too much wrought up to perceive,\r\n",
      "and the instruments that would have reported it were out of action\r\n",
      "because of destroyed insulation. When the ventilation-slit was closed\r\n",
      "as the ship took off, it did not close completely; a large beetle\r\n",

      "oxygen-starvation without realizing what had happened, just as human\r\n",
      "pilots sometimes black out from the same cause before they know what is\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But this lone Qul-En was seeking a complex hormone substance which\r\n",
      "Qul-En medical science said theoretically must exist, but the molecule\r\n",
      "of which even the Qul-En could not synthesize directly. Yet it had to\r\n",
      "be found, in great quantity; once discovered, the problem of obtaining\r\n",
      "it would be taken up, with the resources of the whole race behind it.\r\n",
      "But first it had to be found.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tiny ship assigned to explore the Solar System for the hormone\r\n",
      "wished to pass unnoticed. Its mission of discovery should be\r\n",
      "accomplished in secrecy if possible. For one thing, the desired hormone\r\n",
      "would be destroyed by contact with the typical Qul-En ray-gun beam, so\r\n",
      "that normal methods of securing zoological specimens could not be used.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ship winked into being in empty space, not far from Neptune. It\r\n",
      "drove for that chilly planet, hovered about it, and decided not to\r\n",
      "land. It sped inward toward the sun and touched briefly on Io, but\r\n",
      "found no life there. It dropped into the atmosphere of Mars, and did\r\n",
      "not rise again for a full week, but the vegetation on Mars is thin and\r\n",
      "the animals mere degenerate survivors of once specialized forms. The\r\n",
      "ship came to Earth, hovered lightly at the atmosphere's very edge for\r\n",
      "a long time, and doubtless chose its point of descent for reasons that\r\n",
      "seemed good to its occupant. Then it landed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It actually touched Earth at night. There was no rocket-drive to call\r\n",
      "attention and by dawn it was well-concealed. Only one living creature\r\n",
      "had seen it land--a mountain-lion. Even so, by midday the skeleton of\r\n",
      "the lion was picked clean by buzzards, with ants tidying up after them.\r\n",
      "And the Qul-En in the ship was enormously pleased. The carcass, before\r\n",
      "being abandoned to the buzzards, had been studied with an incredible\r\n",
      "competence. The lion's nervous system--particularly the mass of tissue\r\n",
      "in the skull--unquestionably contained either the desired hormone\r\n",
      "itself, or something so close to it that it could be modified and the\r\n",
      "hormone produced. It remained only to discover how large a supply of\r\n",
      "the precious material could be found on earth. It was not feasible\r\n",
      "to destroy a group of animals--say, of the local civilized race--and\r\n",
      "examine their bodies, because the hormone would be broken down by the\r\n",
      "weapon which allowed of a search for it. So an estimate of available\r\n",
      "sources would have to be made by sampling. The Qul-En in the ship\r\n",
      "prepared to take samples.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ship had landed in tumbled country some forty miles south of\r\n",
      "Ensenada Springs, national forest territory, on which grazing-rights\r\n",
      "were allotted to sheep-ranchers after illimitable red tape. Within ten\r\n",
      "miles of the hidden ship there were rabbits, birds, deer, coyotes, a\r\n",
      "lobo wolf or two, assorted chipmunks, field-mice, perhaps as many as\r\n",
      "three or four mountain-lions, one flock of two thousand sheep, one man,\r\n",
      "and one dog.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man was Antonio Menendez. He was ancient, unwashed, and ignorant,\r\n",
      "and the official shepherd of the sheep. The dog was Salazar, of dubious\r\n",
      "ancestry but sound worth, who actually took care of the sheep and\r\n",
      "knew it; he was scarred from battles done in their defense. He was\r\n",
      "unweariedly solicitous of the wooly half-wits in his charge. There were\r\n",
      "whole hours when he could not find time to scratch himself, because of\r\n",
      "his duties. He was reasonably fond of Antonio, but knew that the man\r\n",
      "did not really understand sheep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Besides these creatures, among whom the Qul-En expected to find its\r\n",
      "samples, there were insects. These, however, the tiny alien being\r\n",
      "disregarded. It would not be practical to get any great quantity of the\r\n",
      "substance it sought from such small organisms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By nightfall of the day after its landing, the door of the ship\r\n",
      "opened and the explorer came out in a vehicle designed expressly for\r\n",
      "sampling on this planet. The vehicle came out, stood on its hind legs,\r\n",
      "closed the door, and piled brush back to hide it. Then it moved away\r\n",
      "with the easy, feline gait of a mountain-lion. At a distance of two\r\n",
      "feet it was a mountain-lion. It was a magnificent job of adapting\r\n",
      "Qul-En engineering to the production of a device which would carry a\r\n",
      "small-bodied explorer about a strange world without causing remark.\r\n",
      "The explorer nested in a small cabin occupying the space--in the\r\n",
      "facsimile lion--that had been occupied by the real lion's lungs. The\r\n",
      "fur of the duplicate was convincing; its eyes were excellent, housing\r\n",
      "scanning-cells which could make use of anything from ultraviolet far\r\n",
      "down into the infra-red. Its claws were retractable and of plastic\r\n",
      "much stronger and keener than the original lion's claws. It had\r\n",
      "other equipment, including a weapon against which nothing on this\r\n",
      "planet could stand, and for zoological sampling it had one remarkable\r\n",
      "advantage. It had no animal smell; it was all metal and plastics.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the first night of its roaming, nothing in particular happened. The\r\n",
      "explorer became completely familiar with the way the controls of the\r\n",
      "machine worked. As a machine, of course, it was vastly more powerful\r\n",
      "than an animal. It could make leaps no mere creature of flesh and\r\n",
      "blood could duplicate; its balancing devices were admirable; it was,\r\n",
      "naturally, immune to fatigue. The Qul-En inside it was pleased with the\r\n",
      "job.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That night Antonio and Salazar bedded down their sheep in a natural\r\n",
      "amphitheatre and Antonio slept heavily, snoring. He was a highly\r\n",
      "superstitious ancient, so he wore various charms of a quasi-religious\r\n",
      "nature. Salazar merely turned around three times and went to sleep.\r\n",
      "But while the man slept soundly, Salazar woke often. Once he waked\r\n",
      "sharply at a startled squawking among the lambs. He got up and trotted\r\n",
      "over to make sure that everything was all right, sniffed the air\r\n",
      "suspiciously. Then he went back, scratched where a flea had bitten\r\n",
      "him, bit--nibbling--at a place his paws could not reach, and went\r\n",
      "back to sleep. At midnight he made a clear circle around his flock\r\n",
      "and went back to slumber with satisfaction. Toward dawn he raised his\r\n",
      "head suspiciously at the sound of a coyote's howl, but the howl was\r\n",
      "far away. Salazar dozed until daybreak, when he rose, shook himself,\r\n",
      "stretched himself elaborately, scratched thoroughly, and was ready for\r\n",
      "a new day. The man waked, wheezing, and cooked breakfast; it appeared\r\n",
      "that the normal order of things would go undisturbed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a time it did; there was certainly no disturbance at the ship. The\r\n",
      "small silvery vessel was safely hidden. There was a tiny, flickering\r\n",
      "light inside--the size of a pin-point--which wavered and changed color\r\n",
      "constantly where a sort of tape unrolled before it. It was a recording\r\n",
      "device, making note of everything the roaming pseudo-mountain-lion's\r\n",
      "eyes saw and everything its micro-phonic ears listened to. There was\r\n",
      "a bank of air-purifying chemical which proceeded to regenerate itself\r\n",
      "by means of air entering through a small ventilating slot. It got rid\r\n",
      "of carbon dioxide and stored up oxygen in its place, in readiness for\r\n",
      "further voyaging.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course, ants explored the whole outside of the space-vessel, and\r\n",
      "some went inside through the ventilator-opening. They began to cart\r\n",
      "off some interesting if novel foodstuff they found within. Some very\r\n",
      "tiny beetles came exploring, and one variety found the air-purifying\r\n",
      "chemical refreshing. Numbers of that sort of beetle moved in and began\r\n",
      "to raise large families. A minuscule moth, too, dropped eggs lavishly\r\n",
      "in the nest-like space in which the Qul-En explorer normally reposed\r\n",
      "during space-flight. But nothing really happened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not until late morning. It was two hours after breakfast-time\r\n",
      "when Salazar found traces of the mountain-lion which was not a\r\n",
      "mountain-lion. He found a rabbit that had been killed. Having been\r\n",
      "killed, it had very carefully been opened up, its various internal\r\n",
      "organs spread out for examination, and its nervous system traced in\r\n",
      "detail. Its brain-tissue, particularly, had been most painstakingly\r\n",
      "dissected, so the amount of a certain complex hormone to be found in it\r\n",
      "could be calculated with precision. The Qul-En in the lion shape had\r\n",
      "been vastly pleased to find the sought-for hormone in another animal\r\n",
      "besides a mountain-lion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dissection job was a perfect anatomical demonstration; no\r\n",
      "instructor in anatomy could have done better, and few neuro-surgeons\r\n",
      "could have done as well with the brain. It was, in fact, a perfect\r\n",
      "laboratory job done on a flat rock in the middle of a sheep-range,\r\n",
      "and duly reproduced on tape by a flickering, color-changing light. The\r\n",
      "reproduction, however, was not as good as it should have been, because\r\n",
      "the tape was then covered by small ants who had found its coating\r\n",
      "palatable and were trying to clean it off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Salazar saw the rabbit. There were blow-flies buzzing about it, and a\r\n",
      "buzzard was reluctantly flying away because of his approach. Salazar\r\n",
      "barked at the buzzard. Antonio heard the barking; he came.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Antonio was ancient, superstitious, and unwashed. He came wheezing,\r\n",
      "accompanied by flies who had not finished breakfasting on the bits\r\n",
      "of his morning meal he had dropped on his vest. Salazar wagged his\r\n",
      "tail and barked at the buzzard. The rabbit had been neatly dissected,\r\n",
      "but not eaten. The cuts which opened it up were those of a knife or\r\n",
      "scalpel. It was not--it was definitely not!--the work of an animal.\r\n",
      "But there were mountain-lion tracks, and nothing else. More, every one\r\n",
      "of the tracks was that of a hind foot! A true mountain-lion eats what\r\n",
      "he catches; he does not stand on his hind paws and dissect it with\r\n",
      "scientific precision. Nothing earthly had done this!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Antonio's eyes bulged out. He thought instantly of magic, Black Magic.\r\n",
      "He could not imagine dissection in the spirit of scientific inquiry;\r\n",
      "to him, anything that killed and then acted in this fashion could only\r\n",
      "come from the devil.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gasped and fled, squawking. When he had run a good hundred yards,\r\n",
      "Salazar caught up to him, very much astonished. He overtook his master\r\n",
      "and went on ahead to see what had scared the man so. He made casts to\r\n",
      "right and left, then went in a conscientious circle all around the\r\n",
      "flock under his care. Presently he came back to Antonio, his tongue\r\n",
      "lolling out, to assure him that everything was all right. But Antonio\r\n",
      "was packing, with shaking hands and a sweat-streaked brow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In no case is the neighborhood of a mountain-lion desirable for a man\r\n",
      "with a flock of sheep. But this was no ordinary mountain-lion. Why,\r\n",
      "Salazar--honest, stout-hearted Salazar--did not scent a mountain-lion\r\n",
      "in those tracks. He would have mentioned it vociferously if he had, so\r\n",
      "this was beyond nature. The lion was _un fantasmo_ or worse; Antonio's\r\n",
      "thoughts ran to were-tigers, ghost-lions, and sheer Indian devils. He\r\n",
      "packed, while Salazar scratched fleas and wondered what was the matter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They got the flock on the move. The sheep made idiotic efforts to\r\n",
      "disperse and feed placidly where they were. Salazar rounded them up and\r\n",
      "drove them on. It was hard work, but even Antonio helped in frantic\r\n",
      "energy--which was unusual.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Near noon, four miles from their former grazing-ground, there were\r\n",
      "mountain-peaks all around them. Some were snow-capped, and there were\r\n",
      "vistas of illimitable distance everywhere. It was very beautiful\r\n",
      "indeed, but Antonio did not notice; Salazar came upon buzzards again.\r\n",
      "He chased them with loud barkings from the meal they reluctantly\r\n",

      "to provide at a glance all significant information about the genus\r\n",
      "_canis_, species _latrans_, in the person of an adult male coyote. It\r\n",
      "was a most enlightening exhibit; it proved conclusively that there was\r\n",
      "a third type of animal, structurally different from both mountain-lions\r\n",
      "and rabbits, which had the same general type of nervous system, with a\r\n",
      "mass of nerve-tissue in one large mass in a skull, which nerve-tissue\r\n",
      "contained the same high percentage of the desired hormone as the\r\n",
      "previous specimens. Had it been recorded by a tiny colored flame in the\r\n",
      "hidden ship--the flame was now being much admired by small red bugs\r\n",
      "and tiny spiders--it would have been proof that the Qul-En would find\r\n",
      "ample supplies on Earth of the complex hormone on which the welfare of\r\n",
      "their race now depended. Some members of the Qul-En race, indeed, would\r\n",
      "have looked no farther. But sampling which involved only three separate\r\n",
      "species and gave no proof of their frequency was not quite enough;\r\n",

      "breast-bone. One-half the carcass had been left intact; the other half\r\n",
      "was completely anatomized, and the brain had been beautifully dissected\r\n",
      "and spread out for measurement. Antonio realized that intelligence had\r\n",
      "been at work. But--again--he saw only the pad-tracks of a mountain\r\n",
      "lion, and he was literally paralyzed by horror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Antonio was scared enough to be galvanized into unbelievable energy. He\r\n",
      "would have fled gibbering to Ensenada Springs, some forty miles as the\r\n",
      "crow flies, but to flee would be doom itself. The devils who did this\r\n",

      "in a single mass of nerve-tissue was normal on this planet! The vast\r\n",
      "majority of animals should have it. Even the local civilized race might\r\n",
      "have skulls with brains in them, and, from the cities observed from the\r\n",

      "hailing her as _Senora_ Garcia, and observed in a quavering voice that\r\n",
      "the flies were very bad today. He moved about in his flock, turning the\r\n",
      "direction of its march and acting as if surrounded by a crowd of human\r\n",
      "beings. This should at least confuse the devil whom he saw. And while\r\n",

      "his hind legs which is so difficult to reach. There was only one time\r\n",
      "when he had any difficulty. That was when there was a sort of eddying\r\n",
      "of the sheep, ahead. There were signs of panic. Salazar went trotting\r\n",
      "to the spot. He found sheep milling stupidly, and rams pawing the\r\n",
      "ground defying they had no idea what. Salazar found a deer-carcass on\r\n",
      "the ground and the smell of fresh blood in the air and the sheep upset\r\n",

      "mountain-lion--there were tracks about. Then it, too, had been cut into\r\n",
      "as if by a dissector's scalpel, but the job was incomplete. Actually,\r\n",
      "the pseudo-mountain-lion had been interrupted by the approach of the\r\n",
      "flock. There were hardly blow-flies on the spot as yet. Antonio came\r\n",
      "to it as he chatted insanely with a sheep with sore eyes and a halo of\r\n",
      "midges about its head, whom he addressed as _Senorita_ Carmen. But when\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "To pass a creature laid out for magical ceremony was doom indubitable,\r\n",

      "stark paganism and would involve a heavy penance when next he went to\r\n",
      "confession. He performed other actions, equally deplorable; when he\r\n",
      "went on, the deer was quite spoiled, for neat demonstration of the\r\n",
      "skeletal, circulatory, muscular and especially the nervous system and\r\n",
      "brain-structure of genus _cervus_, species _dama_, specimen an adult\r\n",
      "doe. Antonio had piled over the deer all the brush within reach, had\r\n",
      "poured over it the kerosene he had for his night-lantern, and had\r\n",

      "danger here. It could have slaughtered man and dog and sheep by the\r\n",
      "quiver of a tentacle, but that would have ruined them as specimens. To\r\n",
      "avoid spoiling specimens it intended to take later, the Qul-En put the\r\n",
      "mountain-lion shape into a single, magnificent leap. It soared more\r\n",

      "angrily. He could not tell Antonio that he had come upon something\r\n",
      "in the shape of a mountain-lion, but which was not--it didn't smell\r\n",
      "right--carrying a mangled sheep away from its fellows. He couldn't\r\n",
      "explain that he'd given chase, but the shape made such monstrous\r\n",
      "leaps that he was left behind and pursuit was hopeless. Salazar made\r\n",
      "unhappy, disgusted, disgraced noises to himself. He bristled; he whined\r\n",
      "bitterly. He kept his ears pricked up and he tried twice to dart off\r\n",

      "protected oneself adequately when gathering specimens. But it was\r\n",

      "trembled, but Salazar slept. When the sun was fully risen he arose and\r\n",
      "shook himself; he stretched elaborately, scratched thoroughly, shook\r\n",
      "himself again and was ready for a new day. When Antonio tremblingly\r\n",
      "insisted that they drive the flock on toward the lowlands, Salazar\r\n",

      "Out in space, the silvery ship suddenly winked out of existence. Enough\r\n",

      "utterly necessary to reach its own race and report the salvation it\r\n",
      "had found for them. The record of the flickering flame was ruined. The\r\n",
      "Qul-En felt that itself was dying. But if it could get near enough to\r\n",

      "increasing weakness and spasmodic, gasping breaths. In using the\r\n",
      "killing-ray it had swept all the interior of the ship. But not the\r\n",
      "mountain-lion shape. Naturally! And the mountain-lion shape had killed\r\n",
      "specimens and carried them about. While its foreleg flamed, it had even\r\n",
      "rolled on startled, stupid sheep. It had acquired fleas--perhaps some\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The Qul-En tried desperately to remain alive until a message could\r\n",
      "be given to its people, but it was not possible. There was a slight\r\n",
      "matter the returning explorer was too much wrought up to perceive,\r\n",
      "and the instruments that would have reported it were out of action\r\n",
      "because of destroyed insulation. When the ventilation-slit was closed\r\n",
      "as the ship took off, it did not close completely; a large beetle\r\n",
      "was in the way. There was a most tiny but continuous leakage of air\r\n",
      "past the crushed chitinous armor. The Qul-En in the ship died of\r\n",
      "oxygen-starvation without realizing what had happened, just as human\r\n",
      "pilots sometimes black out from the same cause before they know what is\r\n",

      "went on forever, or until its source of power failed.\r\n",

      "sludge. But they ain't. I guess there was some gaseous metal compounds\r\n",
      "formed--like uranium hexifluoride--and they boil off. But I can't swear\r\n",

      "and it cost plenty. But it isn't closed up any longer. The windows are\r\n",
      "open and Mr. Vachti is sitting in a deck-chair on a terrace, smoking a\r\n",
      "long black cigar. Then I blink; there is Jode, sporty clothes and all,\r\n",
      "waddling out to speak to him. I see a coupla men working around what I\r\n",
      "guessed was the kitchen; then I see Prof Henry Barr in person. He has\r\n",

      "to run out squirming and wagging his tail if he sees somebody, or else\r\n",
      "barking at them. So I have to take him back to the boat and tie him up.\r\n",

      "Mostly Mr. Vachti just don't pay any attention. Jode don't have much\r\n",

      "glad to see me. I take a good look at him. He isn't an old dog any\r\n",
      "more; he is a kind of gangling just-grown puppy, falling all over\r\n",

      "all set to switch glasses so the Prof and Mr. Vachti will be the ones\r\n",

      "been a pure matter of professional pride. If Mr. Vachti plays it like\r\n",
      "it lies, old Jode wins. Mr. Vachti is outsmarted complete, on the\r\n",

      "we beat it for the boat, only I remember to make him go quiet. On the\r\n",
      "way I say to him, severe: \"You'd ought to have let me make that elixir\r\n",
      "like I said. Then you wouldn't'a been in this trouble. I told you the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But after an instant Calhoun stared about him as the vision-screens\r\n",
      "came to life. They showed the cosmos outside the Med Ship. It was a\r\n",
      "perfectly normal cosmos--not at all the cosmos of overdrive--but it\r\n",
      "looked extremely wrong to Calhoun. He and Murgatroyd and the Med Ship\r\n",
      "were in emptiness. There were stars on every hand, and they were of\r\n",

      "stop to view the universe from the monstrous loneliness which is\r\n",
      "Between-the-Stars. All ships go into overdrive as near their port\r\n",
      "of departure as they can. Usually it is something like five or six\r\n",

      "They do not stop to look at scenery on the way. It isn't good for\r\n",

      "or half-disks or mottled cloudy planets swimming within view. The\r\n",
      "sun should have been the star Merida, and Calhoun should land in\r\n",
      "commonplace fashion on Merida II and make a routine planetary health\r\n",
      "check on a settled, complacent population, and presently he should head\r\n",
      "back to Med Headquarters with a report containing absolutely nothing of\r\n",

      "brought out the apparatus designed to take care of a state of things\r\n",
      "like this. If the situation wasn't too bad, correcting it should be\r\n",
      "simple enough. If it was too bad, it could be fatal.\r\n",

      "The average separation of stars throughout the galaxy, of course, is\r\n",
      "something like four or five light-years. The distance between sol-type\r\n",
      "stars is on an average very much higher, and with certain specific\r\n",
      "exceptions habitable planets are satellites of sol-type suns. But only\r\n",
      "a fraction of the habitable planets are colonized, and when a ship has\r\n",
      "traveled blind, in overdrive, for two months or more its pilot cannot\r\n",
      "simply look astern and recognize his point of departure. There's too\r\n",
      "much scenery in between. Further, nobody can locate himself by the use\r\n",
      "of star-maps unless he knows where something on the star-map is, with\r\n",
      "reference to himself. Which makes a star-map not always useful.\r\n",

      "But the present blunder might not be serious. If the Med Ship had\r\n",
      "come out into normal space no more than eight to ten light-years from\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He got out the camera with its six lenses for the six vision-screens\r\n",
      "which showed space in all directions. He clamped it in place and\r\n",
      "painstakingly snapped a plate. In seconds he had everything above third\r\n",
      "magnitude faithfully recorded in its own color, and with relative\r\n",
      "brightnesses expressed in the size of the dots of tint. He put the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He pressed the short-hop button and there was dizziness and nausea\r\n",
      "and a flash of fear--all three sensations momentary. Murgatroyd said,\r\n",
      "\"_Chee_\" in a protesting tone, but Calhoun held down the button for an\r\n",
      "accurate five minutes. He and Murgatroyd gulped together when he let\r\n",
      "up the button again and all space whirled and nausea hit as before. He\r\n",
      "took another plate of all the heavens, made into one by the six-lensed\r\n",
      "camera. He swung the ship by ninety degrees and pressed the short-hop\r\n",
      "button a second time. More dizziness and panic and digestive revolt. In\r\n",
      "five minutes it was repeated as the ship came out to normal space yet\r\n",
      "again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Chee-chee!_\" protested Murgatroyd. His furry paws held his round\r\n",

      "man's regular credentials! Such a scale of values hinted at more than\r\n",
      "a mere isolation syndrome. There were thousands of inhabited worlds,\r\n",
      "now, with splendid cities and technologies which most men accepted with\r\n",
      "the same bland confidence with which they looked for sunrise. The human\r\n",
      "race was civilized. Suspicion of a Med Ship was unheard of. But here\r\n",
      "was a world--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why ... certainly,\" said Calhoun blankly. \"I suppose I may go outside\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"_We'll drive her up to your ship_,\" said the high, tense voice. \"_And\r\n",
      "you stay close to it!_\" Then it said darkly. \"_Men from Two City\r\n",
      "sneaked past our sentries to dump it on us. They want to wipe out our\r\n",

      "Calhoun drew a deep breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "first things first. Drive your cow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He held his head in his hands. He remembered to throw off the\r\n",
      "spacephone and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Murgatroyd, say something sensible! I never ran into anybody quite as\r\n",

      "rational!\"\r\n",

      "agglomeration of buildings that had been piled around the grid's sturdy\r\n",
      "control building. They were clothed in cloth that was heavy and very\r\n",
      "stiff, to judge by the way it shifted with its wearers' movements.\r\n",
      "Calhoun wasn't familiar with it. The men moved stolidly, on foot,\r\n",
      "across the incredible pasture which had been a landing space for ships\r\n",
      "of space at some time or other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They reached a spot where a dark animal form rested on the ground.\r\n",
      "Calhoun hadn't noticed it particularly. Cattle, he knew, folded their\r\n",
      "legs and lay down and chewed cuds. They existed nearly everywhere\r\n",
      "that human colonies had been built. On some worlds there were other\r\n",
      "domestic animals descended from those of Earth. Of course there were\r\n",
      "edible plants and some wholesome animals which had no connection at all\r\n",
      "with humanity's remote ancestral home, but from the beginning human\r\n",
      "beings had been adjusted to symbiosis with the organic life of Earth.\r\n",
      "Foodstuffs of non-terrestrial origin could supplement Earth-food, of\r\n",
      "course. In some cases Earth-foods were the supplements and local,\r\n",
      "non-terrestrial foodstuffs the staples. But human beings did not thrive\r\n",
      "on a wholly un-Earthly diet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The clump of slowly moving men reached the reclining cow. They pulled\r\n",
      "up stakes which surrounded her, and coiled up wire or cordage which had\r\n",
      "made the stakes into a fence. They prodded the animal. Presently it\r\n",
      "lurched to its feet and swung its head about foolishly. They drove it\r\n",
      "toward the Med Ship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fifty yards away they stopped, and the outside microphones brought the\r\n",
      "sound of their voices muttering. By then Calhoun had seen their faces.\r\n",
      "Four of the six were bearded. The other two were young men. On most\r\n",
      "worlds men prided themselves that they needed to shave, but few of them\r\n",
      "omitted the practice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These six moved hastily away, though the two younger ones turned often\r\n",
      "to look back. The cow, deserted, stumbled to a reclining position. It\r\n",
      "lay down, staring stupidly about. It rested its head on the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I go out now, eh?\" asked Calhoun mildly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_We're watching you!_\" grated the spacephone speaker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun glanced at the outside temperature indicator and added a\r\n",
      "garment. He put a blaster in his pocket. He went out the exit port.\r\n",

      "The air was bitter cold, after two months in a heat-metered ship, but\r\n",
      "Calhoun did not feel cold. It took him seconds to understand why.\r\n",
      "It was that the ground was warm. Radiant heat kept him comfortable,\r\n",
      "though the air was icy. Heat elements underground must draw power\r\n",
      "from somewhere--the grid's tapping of the ionosphere--and heated this\r\n",
      "pasture from underneath so forage plants could grow here. They did.\r\n",
      "The cattle fed on them. There would be hydroponic gardens somewhere\r\n",
      "else, probably underground. They would supply vegetable food in greater\r\n",
      "quantity. But in the nature of things human beings had to have animal\r\n",
      "food in a cold climate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun went across the pasture with the frowning snowy mountains\r\n",
      "all about. He regarded the reclining beast with an almost humorous\r\n",
      "attention. He did not know anything about the special diseases of\r\n",
      "domestic animals. He had only the knowledge required of a Med Ship man.\r\n",
      "But that should be adequate. The tense voice had said that this beast\r\n",
      "had been \"dumped,\" to \"wipe out\" the local herd. So there would be\r\n",
      "infection and there would be some infective agent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He painstakingly took samples of blood and saliva. In a ruminant,\r\n",
      "certainly, any digestive-tract infection should show up in the saliva.\r\n",
      "He reflected that he did not know the normal bovine temperature, so he\r\n",
      "couldn't check it. Nor the respiration. But the Interstellar Medical\r\n",
      "Service was not often called on to treat ailing cows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Back in the ship he diluted his samples and put droplets in the usual\r\n",
      "nutrient solutions. He sealed up droplets in those tiny slides which\r\n",
      "allow a culture to be examined as it grows. His microscope, of course,\r\n",
      "allowed of inspection under light of any wave length desired, and so\r\n",
      "yielded information by the frequency of the light which gave clearest\r\n",
      "images of different features of microörganisms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After five minutes of inspection he grunted and hauled out his\r\n",
      "antibiotic stores. He added infinitesimal traces of cillin to the\r\n",
      "culture-media. In the microscope, he watched the active microscopic\r\n",
      "creatures die. He checked with the other samples.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went out to the listless, enfeebled animal. He made a wry guess at\r\n",
      "its body-weight. He used the injector. He went back to the Med Ship. He\r\n",
      "called on the spacephone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think,\" he said politely, \"that your beast will be all right in\r\n",
      "thirty hours or so. Now, how about telling me the name of this sun?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The voice said sharply:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_There's a matter of weapons, too! Wait till we see how the cow does!\r\n",
      "Sunset will come in an hour. When day comes again, if the cow is\r\n",
      "better--we'll see!_\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Calhoun pulled out the log-mike. There was already an audio record\r\n",
      "of all ship-operations and communications. Now he added comments--a\r\n",
      "description of the ribbon in the sky, the appearance of the planet, and\r\n",
      "such conclusions as he'd come to. He ended:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"... The samples from the cow were full of a single coccus, which\r\n",
      "seemed to have no resistance to standard antibiotics. I pumped the\r\n",
      "beast full of cillin and called it a day. I'm concerned, though,\r\n",
      "because of the clear signs of an isolation syndrome here. They're\r\n",
      "idiotically suspicious of me and won't even promise a bargain, as if I\r\n",
      "could somehow overreach them because I'm a stranger. They've sentries\r\n",
      "out--they said somebody sneaked past them--against what I imagine must\r\n",
      "be Two City and Three City. I've an impression that the sentries are\r\n",
      "to enforce a quarantine rather than to put up a fight. It is probable\r\n",
      "that the other communities practice the same tactics--plus biological\r\n",
      "cold war if somebody did bring a sick cow here to infect and destroy\r\n",
      "the local herd. These people may have a landing grid, but they've\r\n",

      "problem in being. If that's so, it's going to be nasty!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He cut off the log. The classic Crusoe problem would be extremely\r\n",
      "awkward if he'd run into it. There was a legend about an individual\r\n",
      "back on old Earth who'd been left isolated on an island by shipwreck\r\n",
      "for half a lifetime. His name was given to the public-health\r\n",
      "difficulties which occurred when accidental isolations occurred during\r\n",
      "the chaotic first centuries of galactic migration. There was one\r\n",
      "shipwreck to which the name was first applied. The ship was missing,\r\n",
      "and the descendants of the crew and passengers were not contacted until\r\n",
      "three generations had passed. Larger-scale and worse cases occurred\r\n",
      "later, when colonies were established by entrepreneurs who grew rich\r\n",
      "in the establishment of the new settlements, and had no interest in\r\n",
      "maintaining them. Such events could hardly happen now, of course, but\r\n",
      "even a Crusoe condition was still possible in theory. It might exist\r\n",
      "here. Calhoun hoped not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It did not occur to him that the affair was not his business because\r\n",
      "he hadn't been assigned to it. He belonged to the Med Service, and\r\n",
      "the physical well-being of humans everywhere was the concern of that\r\n",
      "service. If people lived by choice in an inhospitable environment, that\r\n",
      "was not a Med man's problem, but anything which led to preventable\r\n",
      "deaths was. And in a Crusoe colony there were plenty of preventable\r\n",
      "deaths!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He cooked a meal to have something to occupy his mind. Murgatroyd sat\r\n",
      "on his haunches and sniffed blissfully. Presently Calhoun ate, and\r\n",
      "again presently darkness fell on this part of the world. There were new\r\n",
      "noises--small ones. He went to look. The pasture inside the landing\r\n",
      "grid was faintly lighted by the glowing ribbon in the sky. It looked\r\n",
      "like a many-times-brighter Milky Way. The girders of the landing grid\r\n",
      "looked very black against it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He saw a dark figure plodding away until he vanished. Then he\r\n",
      "reappeared as a deeper black against the snow beyond the pasture. He\r\n",
      "went on and on until he disappeared again. A long time later another\r\n",
      "figure appeared where he'd gone out of sight. It plodded back toward\r\n",
      "the grid. It was a different individual. Calhoun had watched a changing\r\n",
      "of sentries. Suspicion. Hostility. The least attractive qualities of\r\n",
      "the human race, brought out by isolation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There could not be a large population here, since such suspicions\r\n",
      "existed. And it was divided into--most likely--three again-isolated\r\n",
      "communities. This one had the landing grid, which meant power, and\r\n",
      "a spacephone but no vision screen attached to it. The fact that\r\n",
      "there were hostile separate communities made the situation much more\r\n",
      "difficult, from a medical point of view. It multiplied the possible\r\n",
      "ghastly features which could exist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Murgatroyd ate until his furry belly was round as a ball, and settled\r\n",
      "to stuffed slumber with his tail curled around his nose. Calhoun tried\r\n",
      "to read. But he was restless. His own time-cycle on the ship did not\r\n",
      "in the least agree with the time of daylight on this planet. He was\r\n",
      "wakeful when there was utter quiet outside. Once one of the cattle made\r\n",
      "a dismal lowing noise. Twice or three times he heard cracking sounds,\r\n",
      "like sharp detonations, from the mountains. They would be stirrings in\r\n",
      "the glaciers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He tried to study, but painstaking analysis of the methods by which\r\n",
      "human brains defeated their own ends and came up with wrong answers was\r\n",
      "not appealing. He grew horribly restless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had been dark for hours when he heard rustling noises on the\r\n",
      "ground outside--through the microphones, of course. He turned up the\r\n",
      "amplification and made sure that a small party of men moved toward the\r\n",
      "Med Ship. From time to time they paused, as if in caution.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Murgatroyd,\" he said dryly, \"we're going to have visitors. They didn't\r\n",
      "give notice by spacephone, so they're unauthorized.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Murgatroyd blinked awake. He watched as Calhoun made sure of the\r\n",
      "blaster in his pocket and turned on the log-mike. He said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All set, Murgatroyd?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Murgatroyd said \"_Chee_\" in his small shrill voice just as a soft and\r\n",
      "urgent knock sounded on the exit-lock door. It was made with bare\r\n",
      "knuckles. Calhoun grimaced and went into the lock. He undogged the door\r\n",
      "and began to open it, when it was whipped from his grasp and plunging\r\n",
      "figures pushed in. They swept him back into the Med Ship's cabin. He\r\n",
      "heard the lock-door close softly. Then he faced five roughly, heavily\r\n",
      "clothed men who wore cloaks and mittens and hoods, with cloth stretched\r\n",
      "tightly across their faces below the eyes. He saw knives, but no\r\n",
      "blasters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A stocky figure with cold gray eyes appeared as spokesman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're the man who got landed today,\" he said in a deep voice and with\r\n",
      "an effect of curtness. \"My name's Hunt. Two City. You're a Med Ship\r\n",
      "man?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's right,\" said Calhoun. The eyes upon him were more scared than\r\n",
      "threatening--all but the stocky man named Hunt. \"I landed to find out\r\n",
      "where I was,\" he added. \"The data-card for my astrogator had been\r\n",
      "punched wrong. What--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You know about sickness, eh?\" demanded the stocky man evenly. \"How to\r\n",
      "cure it and stop it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm a Med Ship man,\" admitted Calhoun. \"For whatever that may mean.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're needed in Two City,\" said the deep-voiced Hunt. His manner was\r\n",
      "purest resolution. \"We came to get you. Get y'medicines. Dress warm.\r\n",
      "Load us down, if you like, with what you want to take. We got a sledge\r\n",
      "waiting.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun felt a momentary relief. This might make his job vastly\r\n",
      "easier. When isolation and fear brings a freezing of the mind against\r\n",
      "any novelty--even hope--a medical man has his troubles. But if one\r\n",
      "community welcomed him--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Chee!_\" said Murgatroyd indignantly from overhead. Calhoun glanced\r\n",
      "up and Murgatroyd glared from a paw-hold near the ceiling. He was a\r\n",
      "peaceable animal. When there was scuffling he got out of the way. But\r\n",
      "now he chattered angrily. The masked men looked at him fearfully. But\r\n",
      "their deep-voiced leader growled at them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just a animal.\" He swung back to Calhoun. \"We got a need for you,\" he\r\n",
      "repeated. \"We mean all right, and anything we got you can have if you\r\n",
      "want it. But you're coming with us!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are your good intentions,\" asked Calhoun, \"proved by your wearing\r\n",
      "masks?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They're to keep from catchin' your sickness,\" said the deep voice\r\n",
      "impatiently. \"Point to what you want us to take!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun's feeling of encouragement vanished. He winced a little. The\r\n",
      "isolation syndrome was fully developed. It was a matter of faith that\r\n",
      "strangers were dangerous. All men were assumed to carry contagion.\r\n",
      "Once, they'd have been believed to carry bad luck. But a regained\r\n",
      "primitiveness would still retain some trace of the culture from which\r\n",
      "it had fallen. If there were three settlements as the pastureslands\r\n",
      "seen from space suggested, they would not believe in magic, but they\r\n",
      "would believe in contagion. They might have, or once have had, good\r\n",
      "reason. Anyhow they would fanatically refrain from contact with any but\r\n",
      "their own fellow-citizens. Yet there would always be troubles to excite\r\n",
      "their terrors. In groups of more than a very few there would always be\r\n",
      "an impulse against the isolation which seemed the only possible safety\r\n",
      "in a hostile world. The effectiveness of the counter-instinct would\r\n",
      "depend in part on communications, but the urge to exogamy can produce\r\n",
      "ghastly results in a small culture gone fanatic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think,\" said Calhoun, \"that I'd better come with you. But the people\r\n",
      "here have to know I've gone. I wouldn't like them to heave my ship out\r\n",
      "to space in pure panic because I didn't answer from inside it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Leave a writing,\" said Hunt's deep voice, as impatiently as before.\r\n",
      "\"I'll write it. Make them boil, but they don't dare follow us!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Think One City men,\" asked the stocky man scornfully, \"will risk us\r\n",
      "toppling avalanches on them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun saw. Amid mountain-country in a polar zone, travel would be\r\n",
      "difficult at best. These intruders had risked much to come here for\r\n",
      "him. But they were proud of their daring. They did not believe that\r\n",
      "the folk of lesser cities--tribes--groups than theirs had courage like\r\n",
      "theirs. Calhoun recognized it as a part of that complex of symptoms\r\n",
      "which can begin with an epidemic and end with group-madness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll want this--and this--and that,\" said Calhoun. He wouldn't risk\r\n",
      "his microscope. Antibiotics might be useful. Antiseptics, definitely.\r\n",
      "His med-kit--\"That's all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your blankets,\" said Hunt. \"Y'want them, too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun shrugged. He clothed himself for the cold outside. He had\r\n",
      "a blaster in his pocket, but he casually and openly took down a\r\n",
      "blast-rifle. His captors offered no objection. He shrugged again and\r\n",
      "replaced it. Starting to take it was only a test. He made a guess that\r\n",
      "this stocky leader, Hunt, might have kept his community just a little\r\n",
      "more nearly sane than the group that had set him to the cure of a sick\r\n",
      "cow. He hoped so.\r\n",

      "sky? I suspect it accounts for the terrestrial plants and animals here,\r\n",
      "indirectly. There wouldn't be an accidental planting of edible nuts and\r\n",
      "fish and squirrels and pigeons and rabbits and bumblebees! I suspect\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Hunt shrugged his shoulders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When I talk to him,\" added Calhoun, \"he doesn't pay attention.\r\n",
      "He simply gazes at Nym and beams. The man's mad! But you're his\r\n",

      "foodstuffs here, and the temperature--Calhoun estimated it at fifty\r\n",
      "degrees--seemed to him incredibly balmy. Now he thoughtfully separated\r\n",
      "one fish from the rest and with a certain new skill began to slice away\r\n",
      "two neatly boneless fillets. Calhoun had showed him the trick the day\r\n",
      "after a lesson in fish-spearing, which was two days after their arrival.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Children in Three City,\" growled Hunt, \"are taught the same as in Two\r\n",
      "City. Men came to this planet to work the mines. There was a company\r\n",
      "which sent them, and every so often it sent ships to take what the\r\n",
      "mines yielded, and to bring things the people wanted. Men lived well\r\n",
      "and happily. The company hung the ribbon in the sky so the hotlands\r\n",
      "could grow food for the men. But presently the mines could not deliver\r\n",
      "what they made to the ships when they came. The hotlands grew bigger,\r\n",
      "the glaciers flowed faster, and the pipes between the cities were\r\n",
      "broken and could not be kept repaired. So the company said that since\r\n",
      "the mine-products could no longer be had, it could not send the ships.\r\n",
      "Those who wanted to move to other worlds would be carried there. Some\r\n",
      "men went, with their wives and children. But the grandfathers of our\r\n",
      "fathers' grandfathers were contented here. They had homes and heat and\r\n",
      "food. They would not go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hunt regarded the pinkish brook trout fillet he'd just separated. He\r\n",
      "bit off a mouthful and chewed, thoughtfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That really tastes better cooked,\" said Calhoun mildly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But it is good this way also,\" said Hunt. He was grizzled and stocky\r\n",
      "and somehow possessed of dignity which was not to be lost merely by\r\n",
      "eating raw fish. He waved the remainder of the fillet. \"Then the ships\r\n",
      "ceased to come. Then sickness came. One City had a sickness it gave to\r\n",
      "people of Two and Three when they visited it. Two City had a sickness\r\n",
      "it gave to One and Three. Three City--\" He grunted. \"Our children in\r\n",
      "Two say only Two City people have no sickness. Three City children are\r\n",
      "taught that only Three City is clean of sickness.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun said nothing. Murgatroyd tried to gnaw open one of the nuts\r\n",
      "he'd brought down from the tree. Calhoun took it and another and struck\r\n",
      "them together. Both cracked. He gave them to Murgatroyd, who ate them\r\n",
      "with great satisfaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hunt looked up suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pat did not give a Three City sickness to Nym,\" he observed, \"so our\r\n",
      "thinking was wrong. And Nym has not given a Two City sickness to him.\r\n",
      "His thinking was wrong.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun said meditatively:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's tricky. But sickness can be kept by a carrier, just as you people\r\n",
      "have believed of other cities. A carrier has a sickness but does not\r\n",
      "know it. People around the carrier have the sickness on their bodies\r\n",
      "or their clothing from the carrier. They distribute it. Soon everybody\r\n",
      "in the city where there is a carrier--\" Calhoun had a moment's qualm\r\n",
      "because he used the word \"city.\" But to Hunt the idea conveyed was a\r\n",
      "bare few hundred people. \"Soon everybody is used to the sickness. They\r\n",
      "are immune. They cannot know it. But somebody from another city can\r\n",
      "come, and they are not used to the sickness, and they become ill and\r\n",
      "die.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hunt considered shrewdly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because the sickness is on clothing? From the carrier?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun nodded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Different carriers have different sicknesses. So one carrier in One\r\n",
      "City might have one disease, and all the people in One City became\r\n",
      "used to it while they were babies--became immune. There could be\r\n",
      "another carrier with another sickness in Two City. A third in Three\r\n",
      "City. In each city they were used to their own sickness--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That is it,\" said Hunt, nodding. \"But why is Pat not dying? Or Nym?\r\n",
      "Why do you do nothing to keep them alive?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Suppose,\" said Calhoun, \"the carrier of a sickness dies. What happens?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hunt bit again, and chewed. Suddenly he choked. He sputtered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There is no sickness to spread on the clothing! The people no longer\r\n",
      "have it to give to strangers who are not used to it! The babies do not\r\n",
      "get used to it while they are little! There is no longer a One City\r\n",
      "sickness or a Two City sickness or a Three!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There is,\" said Calhoun, \"only a profound belief in them. You had it.\r\n",
      "Everybody else still has it. And the cities are isolated and put out\r\n",
      "sentries because they believe in what used to be true. And people like\r\n",
      "Nym and Pat run away in the snow and die of it. There is much death\r\n",
      "because of it. You would have died of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hunt chewed and swallowed. Then he grinned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now what?\" His deep voice was quaintly respectful to Calhoun, so much\r\n",
      "younger than himself. \"I like this! We were not fools to believe,\r\n",
      "because it was true. But we are fools if we still believe, because it\r\n",
      "is not true any more. How do we make people understand, Calhoun? You\r\n",
      "tell me. I can handle people when they are not afraid. I can make them\r\n",
      "do what I think wise--when they are not afraid. But when they fear--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When they fear,\" said Calhoun dryly, \"they want a stranger to tell\r\n",
      "them what to do. You came for me, remember? You are a stranger to One\r\n",
      "City and Three City. Pat is a Stranger to Two City. If the cities\r\n",
      "become really afraid--\"\r\n",

      "reminded of the elected president of a highly cultured planet, who had\r\n",
      "exactly that completely intent way of looking at one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go on!\" said Hunt. \"How frighten them into--this?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He waved his hand about. Calhoun, his tone very dry indeed, told him.\r\n",
      "Words would not be enough. Threats would not be enough. Promises would\r\n",
      "not be enough. But rabbits and pigeons and squirrels and fish--fish\r\n",
      "that were frozen like other human food--and piles of edible nuts....\r\n",
      "They would not be enough either, by themselves. But--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An isolation syndrome is a neurotic condition, and a Crusoe problem\r\n",
      "amounts to neurotic hypochondria. You can do it--you and Pat.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I hate the cold, now. But I will do it. After all, if I am to have\r\n",
      "grandchildren there should be other children for them to play with!\r\n",
      "And we will take you back to your ship?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "anyhow?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Calhoun slipped across the pasture inside the landing grid and examined\r\n",
      "the ship from the outside. There had been batterings, but the door\r\n",
      "had not been opened. In the light of the ribbon in the sky he could\r\n",
      "see, too, that the ground was trampled down but only at a respectful\r\n",
      "distance. One City was disturbed about the Med Ship. But it did not\r\n",
      "know what to do. So long as nothing happened from it....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was working the combination lock-door when something hopped,\r\n",
      "low-down and near him. He jumped, and Murgatroyd said, \"_Chee?_\" Then\r\n",
      "Calhoun realized what had startled him. He finished the unlocking of\r\n",
      "the port. He went in and closed the port behind him. The air inside\r\n",
      "seemed curiously dead, after so long a time outside. He flipped on\r\n",
      "the outside microphones and heard tiny patterings. He heard mildly\r\n",
      "resentful cooings. He grinned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When morning came, the people of One City would find their pastureland\r\n",
      "inhabited by small snowshoe rabbits and small and bush-tailed squirrels\r\n",
      "and fluttering pigeons. They would react as Two City and Three City had\r\n",
      "already done--with panic. And panic would inevitably call up the notion\r\n",
      "of the most-feared thing in their lives. Sickness. The most-feared\r\n",
      "thing is always a rare thing, of course. One cannot fear a frequent\r\n",
      "thing, because one either dies of it or comes to take it for granted.\r\n",
      "Fear is always of the rare or nonexistent. One City would be filled\r\n",
      "with fear of sickness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And sickness would come. Hunt would call them, presently, on a\r\n",
      "walkie-talkie communicator. He would express deep concern because--so\r\n",
      "he'd say--new domestic animals intended for Two City had been dumped\r\n",
      "on One City pastureland. He'd add that they were highly infective, and\r\n",
      "Two City was already inescapably doomed to an epidemic which would\r\n",
      "begin with severe headaches, and would continue with cramps and extreme\r\n",
      "nervous agitation. And he would say that Calhoun had left medicines at\r\n",
      "Two City with which that sickness and all others could be cured, and\r\n",
      "if the sickness described should appear in One City--why--its victims\r\n",
      "could be cured if they traveled to Two City.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sickness would appear. Inevitably. There was no longer sickness in\r\n",
      "the three communities. Arctic colonies, never visited by people from\r\n",
      "reservoirs of infection, become magnificently healthy by the operation\r\n",
      "of purely natural causes. But an isolation syndrome....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The people of One City would presently travel, groaning, to Two City.\r\n",
      "Their suffering would be real. They would dread the breaking of\r\n",
      "their isolation. But they'd dread sickness--even sickness they only\r\n",
      "imagined--still more. And when they reached Two City they would find\r\n",
      "themselves tended by Three City members, and they would be appalled\r\n",
      "and terrified. But mumbo-jumbo medication by Hunt and Pat--and Nym for\r\n",
      "the women--would reassure them. A Crusoe condition requires heroic\r\n",
      "treatment. This was it.\r\n",

      "their mining business and they had to write the whole colony off.\r\n",

      "in whatever is happening. But I was asked for by the planetary\r\n",
      "government of Phaedra. I think it likely that your ships come from\r\n",
      "Phaedra. Your grid ship, in particular, wouldn't be needed by the\r\n",

      "won the war! But you may be able to make them realize that they have\r\n",
      "not, and they cannot. We have been foolishly patient, but we can't risk\r\n",
      "forbearance any longer. We mean to carry through to victory even if we\r\n",
      "arrive at cutting our own throats for a victory celebration! And that\r\n",
      "is not unlikely!\"\r\n",

      "\"Our home planet Phaedra has to be evacuated,\" said Walker, very grimly\r\n",
      "indeed. \"There are signs of instability in our sun. Five years since,\r\n",
      "we sent our older children to Canis III to build a world for all of us\r\n",
      "to move to. Our sun could burst at any time. It is certain to flare up\r\n",
      "some time--and soon! We sent our children because the place of danger\r\n",
      "was at home. We urged them to work feverishly. We sent the young women\r\n",
      "as well as the men at the beginning, so that if our planet did crisp\r\n",
      "and melt when our sun went off there would still be children of our\r\n",
      "children to live on. When we dared--when they could feed and shelter\r\n",
      "them--we sent younger boys and girls to safety, overburdening the new\r\n",
      "colony with mouths to feed, but at the least staying ourselves where\r\n",
      "the danger was! Later we sent even the small children, as the signs of\r\n",
      "an imminent cataclysm became more threatening.\"\r\n",

      "Calhoun nodded again. There were not many novas in the galaxy in any\r\n",
      "one year, even among the millions of billions of stars it held. But\r\n",
      "there had been at least one colony which had had to be shifted because\r\n",
      "of evidence of solar instability. The job in that case was not complete\r\n",
      "when the flare-up came. The evacuation of a world, though, would\r\n",
      "never be an easy task. The population had to be moved light-years of\r\n",
      "distance. Space travel takes time, even at thirty times the speed of\r\n",
      "light. Where the time of disaster--the deadline for removal--could not\r\n",
      "be known exactly, the course adopted by Phaedra was logical. Young\r\n",
      "men and women were best sent off first. They could make new homes for\r\n",
      "themselves and for others to follow them. They could work harder and\r\n",
      "longer for the purpose than any other age-group--and they would best\r\n",
      "assure the permanent survival of somebody! The new colony would have\r\n",
      "to be a place of frantic, unresting labor, of feverish round-the-clock\r\n",
      "endeavor, because the time-scale for working was necessarily unknown\r\n",
      "but was extremely unlikely to be enough. When they could be burdened\r\n",
      "further, younger boys and girls would be shipped--old enough to help\r\n",
      "but not to pioneer. They could be sent to safety in a partly-built\r\n",
      "colony. Later smaller children could be sent, needing care from their\r\n",
      "older contemporaries. Only at long last would the adults leave their\r\n",
      "world for the new. They would stay where the danger was until all\r\n",
      "younger ones were secure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But now,\" said Walker thickly, \"our children have made their world and\r\n",
      "now they refuse to receive their parents and grandparents! They have a\r\n",
      "world of young people only, under no authority but their own. They say\r\n",
      "that we lied to them about the coming flare of Phaedra's sun: that we\r\n",
      "enslaved them and made them use their youth to build a new world we\r\n",
      "now demand to take over! They are willing for Phaedra's sun to burst\r\n",

      "Calhoun said nothing. It is a part of medical training to recognize\r\n",
      "that information obtained from others is never wholly accurate.\r\n",
      "Conceding the facts, he would still be getting from Walker only one\r\n",
      "interpretation of them. There is an instinct in the young to become\r\n",
      "independent of adults, and an instinct in adults to be protective\r\n",
      "past all reason. There is, in one sense, always a war between the\r\n",
      "generations on all planets, not only Phaedra and Canis III. It is a\r\n",
      "conflict between instincts which themselves are necessary--and perhaps\r\n",
      "the conflict as such is necessary for some purpose of the race.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They grew tired of the effort building the colony required,\" said\r\n",
      "Walker, his eyes burning as before. \"So they decided to doubt its\r\n",
      "need! They sent some of their number back to Phaedra to verify our\r\n",
      "observations of the sun's behavior. Our observations! It happened that\r\n",
      "they came at a time when the disturbances in the sun were temporarily\r\n",
      "quiet. So our children decided that we were over-timid; that there was\r\n",
      "no danger to us; that we demanded too much! They refused to build more\r\n",
      "shelters and to clear and plant more land. They even refused to land\r\n",
      "more ships from Phaedra, lest we burden them with more mouths to feed!\r\n",
      "They declared for rest; for ease! They declared themselves independent\r\n",

      "soft-hearted! We don't want to kill them--not even after what they've\r\n",
      "done! But they are willing to kill us! Only a week ago we sent a\r\n",
      "cruiser in to broadcast propaganda. We considered that there must be\r\n",
      "some decency left even in our children! No ship can use any drive\r\n",
      "close to a planet, of course. We sent the cruiser in on a course to\r\n",
      "form a parabolic semiorbit, riding momentum down close to atmosphere\r\n",
      "above Canopolis, where it would broadcast on standard communication\r\n",
      "frequencies and go on out to clear space again. But they used the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun did not change expression. This was an interview to learn the\r\n",
      "facts of a situation in which the Med Service had been asked to act. It\r\n",
      "was not an occasion in which to be horrified. He said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What did you expect of the Med Service when you asked for its help?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We thought,\" said Walker, very bitterly indeed, \"that we would have\r\n",
      "prisoners. We prepared hospital ships to tend our children who might be\r\n",
      "hurt. We wanted every possible aid in that. No matter what our children\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He didn't grasp this affair yet. It was too far out of the ordinary\r\n",
      "for quick judgment. Any war, in modern times, would have seemed\r\n",
      "strange enough. But a full-scale war between parents and children on a\r\n",

      "it is better for us to destroy them than to let them destroy our\r\n",
      "grandchildren as they are doing!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This accusation about grandchildren did not seem conceivably true.\r\n",

      "its atmosphere would keep it warmer--by the greenhouse effect--than its\r\n",
      "distance from the local sun would otherwise imply. The snow was winter\r\n",

      "such a ship would be very much like handling an oversized, open-ended\r\n",
      "wastebasket. A monstrous overdrive field would be needed, and keeping\r\n",
      "its metal above brittle-point on any really long space voyage would be\r\n",
      "difficult indeed. But it was here. It had undoubtedly lifted itself\r\n",
      "from Phaedra. It had landed itself here, and should be able to land\r\n",
      "on Canis and then let down after itself the war fleet now clustered\r\n",
      "about its base. But Calhoun tried to take comfort in the difficulty\r\n",
      "of traveling really long distances, up in the tens or twenties of\r\n",
      "light-years, with such a creation. Possibly, just possibly, warfare\r\n",
      "would still be limited to relatively nearby worlds--\r\n",

      "cruiser of which Walker had spoken. Calhoun could see where ragged old\r\n",
      "holes had been made in its hull. Men of middle age or older worked upon\r\n",
      "it with a somehow dogged air. But Walker pointed to another object,\r\n",
      "almost half the size of the Med ship. Men worked on that, too. It was a\r\n",

      "without curiosity, as if too much absorbed in private bitterness to be\r\n",
      "interested in anything else. When they had gone, a small guard brought\r\n",
      "the prisoner. Calhoun noted the expression on the faces of these men,\r\n",
      "too. They hated their prisoner. But their faces showed the deep and\r\n",
      "wrenching bitterness a man does feel when his children have abandoned\r\n",
      "him for companions he considers worthless or worse. A man hates those\r\n",
      "companions corrosively, and these men hated their prisoner. But they\r\n",
      "could not help knowing that he, also, had abandoned some other father\r\n",
      "whose feelings were like their own. So there was frustration even in\r\n",
      "their fury.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The prisoner came lightly up the ladder into the Med ship. He was a\r\n",
      "very young man, with a singularly fair complexion and a carriage at\r\n",
      "once challengingly jaunty and defiant. Calhoun estimated his age\r\n",
      "as seven years less than his own, and immediately considered him\r\n",
      "irritatingly callow and immature because of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're my jailer, eh?\" said the prisoner brightly, as he entered the\r\n",
      "Med ship's cabin. \"Or is this some new trick? They say they're sending\r\n",
      "me back. I doubt it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The young man looked at him brightly. He grinned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" he said happily. \"I won't.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun felt ignoble rage. There had been no great purpose in his\r\n",
      "request. There could be none in the refusal. So he took the prisoner by\r\n",
      "the collar and walked him into the air lock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We are going to be lifted soon,\" he said gently. \"If the outer door\r\n",
      "isn't dogged, the air will escape from the lock. When it does, you will\r\n",
      "die. I can't save you, because if the outer door isn't dogged, all the\r\n",
      "air in the ship will go if I should try to help you. Therefore I advise\r\n",
      "you to dog the door.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He closed the inner door. He looked sick. Murgatroyd looked alarmedly\r\n",
      "at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If I have to deal with that kind,\" Calhoun told the _tormal_, \"I have\r\n",

      "classing me with their fathers!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Med ship stirred. Calhoun glanced at the external-field dial. The\r\n",
      "mobile landing-grid was locking its force-field on. The little ship\r\n",
      "lifted. It went up and up and up. Calhoun looked sicker. The air in\r\n",
      "the lock was thinning swiftly. Two miles high. Three--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were frantic metallic clankings. The indicator said that the\r\n",
      "outer door was dogged tight. Calhoun opened the inner door. The young\r\n",
      "man stumbled in, shockingly white and gasping for breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thanks,\" said Calhoun curtly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He strapped himself in the control-chair. The vision-screens showed\r\n",
      "half the universe pure darkness and the rest a blaze of many-colored\r\n",
      "specks of light. They showed new stars appearing at the edge of the\r\n",
      "monstrous blackness. The Med ship was rising ever more swiftly.\r\n",
      "Presently the black area was not half the universe. It was a third.\r\n",

      "myriad distant suns.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The external-field indicator dropped abruptly to zero. The Med ship was\r\n",

      "It worked. The Med ship swung in a vast curved course out of the dark\r\n",
      "planet's shadow. There was the sun Canis, flaming in space. Calhoun\r\n",
      "made brisk observations, set a new course, and the ship sped on with an\r\n",
      "unfelt acceleration. This was, of course, the Lawlor propulsion system,\r\n",
      "used for distances which were mere millions of miles.\r\n",

      "to try to do something about this war. How'd you get captured?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They made a raid,\" said young Fredericks scornfully. \"They landed a\r\n",
      "rocket out in open country. We thought it was another propaganda bomb,\r\n",
      "like they've landed before--telling us we were scoundrels and such\r\n",
      "bilge. I went to see if there was anything in it good for a laugh. But\r\n",
      "it was bigger than usual. I didn't know, but men had landed in it. They\r\n",
      "jumped me. Two of them. Piled me in the rocket and it took off. Then we\r\n",
      "were picked up and brought where you landed. They tried to mind-launder\r\n",
      "me!\" He laughed derisively. \"Showing me science stuff proving Phaedra's\r\n",
      "sun was going to blow and cook the old home planet. Lecturing me that\r\n",
      "we were all fools on Canis, undutiful sons and so on. Saying that to\r\n",
      "kill our parents wouldn't pay.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Would it?\" asked Calhoun. \"Pay, that is?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You're pulling more of it, huh? I don't know science, but I know\r\n",
      "they've been lying to us! Look! They sent the first gang to Canis five\r\n",
      "years ago. Didn't send equipment with them, no more than they had to.\r\n",
      "Packed the ships full of people. They were twenty years old and so on.\r\n",
      "They had to sweat! Had to sweat out ores and make equipment and try to\r\n",
      "build shelters and plant food. There were more of them arriving all the\r\n",
      "time--shipped away from Phaedra with starvation rations so more of them\r\n",
      "could be shipped. All young people, remember! They had to sweat to keep\r\n",
      "from starving, with all the new ones coming all the time. Everybody had\r\n",
      "to pitch in the minute they got there. You never heard that, did you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Calhoun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They worked plenty!\" said Fredericks scornfully. \"Good little girls\r\n",

      "another month they could breathe easy, why then the old folks on\r\n",
      "Phaedra began to ship younger kids. Me among 'em! I was fifteen, and\r\n",
      "we hit Canis like a flood. There wasn't shelter, or food, or clothes\r\n",
      "to spare, but they had to feed us. So we had to help by working. And\r\n",
      "I worked! I built houses and graded streets and wrestled pipe for\r\n",
      "plumbing and sewage--the older boys were making it--and I planted\r\n",
      "ground and I chopped trees. No loafing! No fun! They piled us on Canis\r\n",
      "so fast it was root hog or die. And we rooted! Then just when we began\r\n",
      "to think that we could begin to take a breather they started dumping\r\n",
      "little kids on us! Ten-year-olds and nine-year-olds to be fed and\r\n",

      "like it was going to burst any minute! They kept us scared that any\r\n",
      "second the ships'd stop coming because there wasn't any more Phaedra.\r\n",
      "And we were good little boys and girls and we worked like hell. We\r\n",
      "tried to build what the kids they sent us needed, and they kept sending\r\n",
      "younger and younger kids. We got to the crack-up point. We couldn't\r\n",
      "keep it up! Night, day, every day, no fun, no loafing, nothing to do\r\n",
      "but work till you dropped, and then get up and work till you dropped\r\n",
      "again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stopped. Calhoun said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So you stopped believing it could be that urgent. You sent some\r\n",
      "messengers back to check and see. And Phaedra's sun looked perfectly\r\n",
      "normal, to them. There was no visible danger. The older people showed\r\n",
      "their scientific records, and your messengers didn't believe them. They\r\n",
      "decided they were faked. They were tired. All of you were tired. Young\r\n",
      "people need fun. You weren't having it. So when your messengers came\r\n",
      "back and said the emergency was a lie--you believed them. You believed\r\n",
      "the older people were simply dumping all their burdens on you, by lies.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We knew it!\" rasped Fredericks. \"So we quit! We'd done our stuff!\r\n",
      "We were going to take time out and do some living! We were away back\r\n",
      "on having fun! We were away back on rest! We were away back just on\r\n",
      "shooting the breeze! We were behind on everything! We'd been slaves,\r\n",
      "following blueprints, digging holes and filling them up again.\" He\r\n",
      "stopped. \"When they said all the old folks were going to move in on\r\n",
      "us, that was the finish! We're human! We've got a right to live like\r\n",
      "humans! When it came to building more houses and planting more land\r\n",
      "so more people--and old people at that--could move in to take over\r\n",
      "bossing us some more, we'd had it! We hadn't gotten anything out of\r\n",
      "the job for ourselves. If the old folks moved in, we never would! They\r\n",
      "didn't mind working us to death! To hell with them!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The reaction,\" said Calhoun, \"was normal. But if one assumption was\r\n",
      "mistaken, it could still be wrong.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What could be wrong?\" demanded Fredericks angrily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The assumption that they lied,\" said Calhoun. \"Maybe Phaedra's sun is\r\n",
      "getting ready to flare. Maybe your messengers were mistaken. Maybe you\r\n",
      "were told the truth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Fredericks gaped at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mop,\" said Calhoun. He gestured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fredericks sneered. Calhoun waited. Murgatroyd said agitatedly:\r\n",

      "\"_Chee! Chee! Chee!_\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun did not move. After a long time, Fredericks took the mop and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Thanks,\" said Calhoun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned back to the control board. He checked his course and referred\r\n",
      "to the half-century-old Survey report on the Canis solar system. He\r\n",
      "scowled. Presently he said over his shoulder:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How has the resting worked? Does everybody feel better?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Enough better,\" said Fredericks ominously, \"so we're going to keep\r\n",
      "things the way they are! The old folks sent in a ship for a landing and\r\n",
      "we took the landing-grid and dumped rocks where it'd run into them.\r\n",
      "We're going to set up little grids all over, so we can fling bombs\r\n",
      "up--we make good bombs--if they try to land anywhere besides Canopolis.\r\n",
      "And if they do make a landing, they'll wish they hadn't! All they've\r\n",
      "dared so far is drop printed stuff calling us names and saying we've\r\n",
      "got to do what they say!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun had the inner planet, Canis III, firmly in the center of his\r\n",
      "forward screen. He said negligently:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How about the little kids? Most of you have quit work, you say--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's not much work,\" bragged Fredericks. \"We had to make stuff\r\n",
      "automatic as we built it, so we could all keep on making more things\r\n",
      "and not lose hands tending stuff we'd made. We got the designs from\r\n",
      "home. We do all right without working much!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun reflected. If it were possible for any society to exist without\r\n",
      "private property, it would be this society, composed exclusively of the\r\n",
      "young. They do not want money as such. They want what it buys--now.\r\n",
      "There would be no capitalists in a world populated only by the younger\r\n",
      "generation from Phaedra. It would be an interesting sort of society,\r\n",
      "but thought for the future would be markedly lacking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But,\" said Calhoun, \"what about the small children? The ones who need\r\n",
      "to be taken care of? You haven't got anything automatic to take care of\r\n",
      "them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pretty near!\" Fredericks boasted. \"Some of the girls like tending\r\n",
      "kids. Homely girls, mostly. But there's too many little ones. So we\r\n",
      "hooked up a psych circuit with multiple outlets for them. Some of\r\n",
      "the girls play with a couple of the kids, and that keeps the others\r\n",
      "satisfied. There was somebody studying pre-psych on Phaedra, and he\r\n",
      "was sent off with the rest to dig holes and build houses. He fixed up\r\n",
      "that trick so the girl he liked would be willing to take time off from\r\n",
      "tending kids. There's plenty of good technicians on Canis III! We can\r\n",
      "make out!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were evidently some very good technicians. But Calhoun began to\r\n",
      "feel sick. A psych circuit, of course, was not in itself a harmful\r\n",
      "device. It was a part of individual psychiatric equipment--not\r\n",
      "Med Service work--and its value was proved. In clinical use it\r\n",
      "permitted a psychiatrist to share the consciousness of his patient\r\n",
      "during interviews. He no longer had painfully to interpret his\r\n",
      "patient's thought-processes by what he said. He could observe the\r\n",
      "thought-processes themselves. He could trace the blocks, the mental\r\n",
      "sore spots, the ugly, not-human urges which can become obsessions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes. A psych circuit was an admirable device in itself. But it was not\r\n",
      "a good thing to use for baby-tending.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There would be a great room in which hundreds of small children would\r\n",
      "sit raptly with psych-circuit receptors on their heads. They would\r\n",
      "sit quietly--very quietly--giggling to themselves, or murmuring.\r\n",
      "They would be having a very wonderful time. Nearby there would be a\r\n",
      "smaller room in which one or two other children played. There would be\r\n",
      "older girls to help these few children actually play. With what they\r\n",
      "considered adult attention every second, and with deep affection for\r\n",
      "their self-appointed nurses--why the children who actually played would\r\n",
      "have the very perfection of childhood pleasure. And their experience\r\n",
      "would be shared by--would simultaneously be known and felt by--would be\r\n",
      "the conscious and complete experience of each of the hundreds of other\r\n",
      "children tuned in on it by psych circuit. Each would feel every thrill\r\n",
      "and sensation of those who truly thrilled and experienced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the children so kept happy would not be kept exercised, nor\r\n",
      "stimulated to act, or think, or react for themselves. The effect of\r\n",
      "psych-circuit child-care would be that of drugs for keeping children\r\n",
      "from needing attention. The merely receiving children would lose all\r\n",
      "initiative, all purpose, all energy. They would come to wait for\r\n",
      "somebody else to play for them. And the death rate among them would\r\n",
      "be high and the health rate among those who lived would be low, and\r\n",
      "the injury to their personalities would be permanent if they played by\r\n",
      "proxy long enough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And there was another uglier thought. In a society such as must exist\r\n",
      "on Canis III, there would be adolescents and post-adolescents who could\r\n",
      "secure incredible, fascinating pleasures for themselves--once they\r\n",
      "realized what could be done with a psych circuit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun said evenly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In thirty minutes or so you can call Canopolis on spacephone. I'd like\r\n",
      "you to call ahead. Will there be anybody on duty at the grid?\"\r\n",

      "I have nothing to do with who runs things, or who they trade or\r\n",

      "It was a very singular society on Canis III. After long and markedly\r\n",
      "irrelevant argument by spacephone, the Med ship went down to ground\r\n",
      "in the grip of the Canopolis landing-grid. This was managed with a\r\n",
      "deftness amounting to artistry. Whoever handled the controls did so\r\n",
      "with that impassioned perfection with which a young man can handle\r\n",
      "a mechanism he understands and worships. But it did not follow that\r\n",
      "so accomplished an operator would think beyond the perfection of\r\n",
      "performance. He came out and grinned proudly at the Med ship when it\r\n",
      "rested, light as a feather, on the clear, grassy space in the center of\r\n",
      "the city's landing-grid. He was a gangling seventeen or eighteen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A gang--not a guard--of similar age came swaggering to interview\r\n",
      "the two in the landed spacecraft. Fredericks named where he'd been\r\n",
      "working and what he'd been doing and how he'd been taken prisoner.\r\n",
      "Nobody bothered to check his statements. But his age was almost a\r\n",
      "guarantee that he belonged on Canis. When he began his experiences as a\r\n",
      "prisoner among their enemies, all pretense of suspicion dropped away.\r\n",
      "The gang at the spaceport interjected questions, and whooped at some\r\n",
      "of his answers, and slapped each other and themselves ecstatically\r\n",
      "when he related some of the things he'd said and done in enemy hands,\r\n",
      "and talked loudly and boastfully of what they would do if the old\r\n",
      "folks tried to carry out their threats. But Calhoun observed no real\r\n",
      "preparations beyond the perfect working condition of the grid itself.\r\n",
      "Still, that ought to defend the planet adequately--except against such\r\n",
      "a mobile spaceport as he'd been captured by, himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they turned to him for added reasons to despise the older\r\n",
      "generation, Calhoun said coldly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you ask me, they can take over any time they're willing to kill a\r\n",
      "few of you to clear the way. Certainly if the way you're running this\r\n",
      "particular job is a sample!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They bristled. And Calhoun marveled at the tribal organization which\r\n",
      "had sprung up among them. What Fredericks had said in the ship began\r\n",
      "to fit neatly into place with what once had been pure anthropological\r\n",
      "theory. He'd had to learn it because a medical man must know more than\r\n",
      "diseases. He must also know the humans who have them. Oddments of\r\n",
      "culture-instinct theory popped into his memory and applied exactly to\r\n",
      "what he was discovering. The theory says that the tribal cultures from\r\n",
      "which even the most civilized social organisms stem--were not human\r\n",
      "inventions. The fundamental facts of human society exist because human\r\n",
      "instinct directs them, in exact parallel to the basic design of the\r\n",
      "social lives of ants and bees. It seemed to Calhoun that he was seeing,\r\n",
      "direct, the operation of pure instinct in the divisions of function in\r\n",
      "the society he had encountered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here, where a guard must be mounted against enemies, he found young\r\n",
      "warriors. They took the task because it was their instinct. It was\r\n",
      "an hereditary impulse for young men of their age to act as youthful\r\n",
      "warriors at a post of danger. There was nothing more important to\r\n",
      "them than prestige among their fellows. They did not want wisdom,\r\n",
      "or security, or families, or possessions. The instinct of their\r\n",
      "age-group directed them as specifically as successive generations of\r\n",
      "social insects are directed. They moved about in gangs. They boasted\r\n",
      "vaingloriously. They loafed conspicuously and they would take lunatic\r\n",
      "risks for no reason whatsoever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But they would never build cities of themselves. That was the impulse\r\n",
      "of older men. In particular, the warrior age-group would be capable of\r\n",
      "immense and admirable skill in handling anything which interested them,\r\n",
      "but they would never devise automatic devices to keep a city going with\r\n",
      "next to no attention. They simply would not think so far ahead. They\r\n",
      "would fight and they would quarrel and they would brag. But if this\r\n",
      "eccentric world had survived so far, it must have additional tribal\r\n",
      "structure--it must have some more dedicated leadership than these\r\n",
      "flamboyant young men who guarded inadequately and operated perfectly\r\n",
      "the mechanism of a spaceport facility they would never have built.\r\n",

      "\"I've got to talk to somebody higher up,\" said Calhoun irritably. \"A\r\n",
      "chief, really--a boss. Your war with your parents isn't my affair. I'm\r\n",
      "here on Med Service business. I'm supposed to check the public health\r\n",
      "situation with the local authorities and exchange information with\r\n",
      "them. So far as I'm concerned, this is a routine job.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The statement was not altogether truthful. In a sense, preventing\r\n",
      "unnecessary deaths was routine, and in that meaning Calhoun had exactly\r\n",
      "the same purpose on Canis III as on any other planet to which he might\r\n",
      "be sent. But the health hazards here were not routine. A society is an\r\n",
      "organism. It is a whole. Instinct-theory says that it can only survive\r\n",
      "as a whole, which must be composed of such-and-such parts. This society\r\n",
      "had suffered trauma, from the predicted dissolution of Phaedra's sun.\r\n",
      "Very many lives would be lost, unnecessarily, unless the results of\r\n",
      "that traumatic experience could be healed. But Calhoun's obligation was\r\n",
      "not to be stated in such terms to these young men.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who is running things?\" demanded Calhoun. \"A man named Walker said his\r\n",
      "son was bossing things here. He was pretty bitter about it, too! Who's\r\n",
      "looking after the distribution of food, and who's assigning who to\r\n",
      "raise more, and who's seeing that the small children get fed and cared\r\n",
      "for?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The spaceport gang looked blank. Then someone said negligently:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We take turns getting stuff to eat, for ourselves. The ones who landed\r\n",
      "here first, mostly, go around yelling at everybody. Sometimes the\r\n",
      "things they want get done. But they're mostly married now. They live in\r\n",
      "a center over yonder.\"\r\n",

      "Fredericks said grandly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll do it. Going that way, anyhow. Who's got a ground-car I can use?\r\n",

      "His proposal to acquire a ground-car was greeted with derision.\r\n",
      "There were ground-cars, but those that did not need repairs were\r\n",
      "jealously reserved by individuals for themselves and their closest\r\n",
      "friends. There was squabbling. Presently a scowling young man agreed\r\n",
      "to deliver Calhoun to the general area in which the first-landed of\r\n",
      "the colonists--now grown grim and authoritative--made their homes.\r\n",
      "It was annoying to wait while so simple a matter was discussed so\r\n",
      "vociferously. By the time it was settled, Fredericks had gone off in\r\n",
      "disgust.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The scowling youth produced his ground-car. Calhoun got in. Murgatroyd,\r\n",
      "of course, was not left behind. And the car was magnificent in\r\n",
      "polish and performance. Lavish effort and real ability had gone into\r\n",
      "its grooming and adjustment. With a spinning of wheels, it shot\r\n",
      "into immediate high speed. The dark-browed younglings drove with\r\n",
      "hair-raising recklessness and expertness. He traversed the city in\r\n",
      "minutes, and at a speed which allowed Calhoun only glimpses. But he\r\n",
      "could see that it was almost unoccupied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Canopolis had been built by the youth of Phaedra to the designs of\r\n",
      "their elders for the reception of immigrants from the mother planet. It\r\n",
      "had been put up in frantic haste and used only as a receiving-depot.\r\n",
      "It had needed impassioned and dedicated labor, and sustained and\r\n",
      "exhausting concentration to get it and the rest of the colonial\r\n",
      "facilities built against a deadline of doom. But now its builders\r\n",
      "were fed up with it. It was practically empty. The last arrivals\r\n",
      "had scattered to places where food supplies were nearer and a more\r\n",
      "satisfactory way of life was possible. There were broken windows and\r\n",
      "spattered walls. There was untidiness everywhere. But there had been\r\n",
      "great pains taken in the building. Some partly-completed enterprises\r\n",
      "showed highly competent workmanship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the city ended and was a giant pile of structures which fell\r\n",
      "swiftly behind. The highways were improvised. They could be made\r\n",
      "more perfect later. Across the horizon there were jerry-built\r\n",
      "villages--temporary by design, because there had been such desperate\r\n",
      "need for so many of them so soon.\r\n",

      "The ground-car came to a stop with a screaming of brakes at the edge of\r\n",
      "such a jerry-built group of small houses. A woman ran to hiding. A man\r\n",
      "ran into view. Another, and another, and another. They came ominously\r\n",
      "toward the car.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun stepped out of the ground-car. It whirled on one pair of wheels\r\n",
      "and sped back to the city, its driver turning to make a derisive\r\n",
      "gesture at the men who had appeared. They were still quite young\r\n",
      "men--younger than Calhoun. They looked at him steadily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He growled to himself. Then he called:\r\n",

      "\"I'm looking for somebody named Walker. He's supposed to be top man\r\n",
      "here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A tense young man said sardonically:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm Walker. But I'm not tops. Where'd you come from? With a Med\r\n",
      "Service uniform and a _tormal_ on your shoulder you're not one of us!\r\n",
      "Have you come to argue that we ought to give in to Phaedra?\"\r\n",

      "Calhoun snorted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've a message that an attack from space is due in three days, but\r\n",
      "that's all from Phaedra. I'm a Med Service man. How's the health\r\n",
      "situation? How are you equipped for doctors and such? How about\r\n",
      "hospitals? How's the death rate?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The younger Walker grinned savagely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This is a new colony. I doubt there are a hundred people on the planet\r\n",
      "over twenty-five. How many doctors would there be in a population like\r\n",
      "ours? I don't think there is a death rate. Do you know how we came to\r\n",
      "be here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your father told me,\" said Calhoun, \"at the military base on the next\r\n",

      "warn you about it. Three days from now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Young Walker ground his teeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They won't dare attack. We'll smash them if they do. They lied to us!\r\n",
      "Worked us to death--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And no death rate?\" asked Calhoun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The younger man knitted his brows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's no use your arguing with us. This is our world! We made it and\r\n",
      "we're keeping it! They made fools of us long enough!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you've no health problems at all?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sardonic young man hesitated. One of the others said coldly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Make him happy. Let him talk to the women. They're worried about some\r\n",
      "of the kids.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun breathed a private sigh of relief. These relatively mature\r\n",
      "young men were the first-landed colonists. They'd had the hardest\r\n",
      "of all the tasks put upon the younger generation by the adults\r\n",
      "of Phaedra. They'd had the most back-breaking labor and the most\r\n",
      "urgent responsibilities. They'd been worked and stressed to the\r\n",
      "breaking-point. They'd finally arrived at a decision of desperation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But apparently things could be worse. It is the custom, everywhere, for\r\n",
      "women to make themselves into whatever is most attractive to men. Young\r\n",
      "girls, in particular, will adopt any tradition which is approved of by\r\n",
      "their prospective husbands. And in a society to be formed brand-new,\r\n",
      "appalling new traditions could be started. But they hadn't. Deep-rooted\r\n",
      "instincts still worked. Women--young women--and girls appeared still\r\n",
      "to feel concern for young children which were not even their own. And\r\n",
      "Fredericks' story--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By all means,\" agreed Calhoun. \"If there's something wrong with the\r\n",
      "health of children--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Young Walker gestured and turned back toward the houses. He scowled as\r\n",
      "he walked. Presently he said defensively:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You probably noticed there aren't many people in the city?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Calhoun. \"I noticed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We're not fully organized yet,\" said Walker, more defensively still.\r\n",
      "\"We weren't doing anything but build. We've got to get organized before\r\n",
      "we'll have a regular economic system. Some of the later-comers don't\r\n",
      "know anything but building. When they're ready for it, the city will be\r\n",
      "occupied. We'll have as sound a system for production and distribution\r\n",
      "of goods as anywhere else. But we've just finished a revolution. In a\r\n",
      "sense we're still in it. But presently this world will be pretty much\r\n",
      "like any other--only better.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see,\" said Calhoun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Most people live in the little settlements, like this--close to the\r\n",
      "crops we grow. People raise their own food, and so on. In a way you may\r\n",
      "think we're primitive, but we've got some good technicians! When they\r\n",
      "get over not having to work for the old folks and finish making things\r\n",
      "just for themselves--we'll do all right. After all, we weren't trained\r\n",
      "to make a complete world. Just to make a world for the older people on\r\n",
      "Phaedra to take over! But we've taken it over for ourselves!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" agreed Calhoun politely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We'll work out the other things,\" said young Walker truculently.\r\n",
      "\"We'll have money, and credit, and hiring each other and so on. Right\r\n",
      "now defending ourselves is the top thing in everybody's mind.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" agreed Calhoun again. He was regarded as not quite an enemy, but\r\n",
      "he was not accepted as wholly neutral.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The older ones of us are married,\" Walker said firmly, \"and we feel\r\n",
      "responsibility, and we're keeping things pretty well in line. We were\r\n",
      "lied to, though, and we resent it. And we aren't letting in the old\r\n",
      "people to try to run us, when we've proved we can make and run a world\r\n",
      "ourselves!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun said nothing. They reached a house. Walker turned to enter it,\r\n",
      "with a gesture for Calhoun to accompany him. Calhoun halted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just a moment. The person who drove me here--when he turned up, at\r\n",
      "least one woman ran away and you men came out ... well ... pretty\r\n",
      "pugnaciously.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Walker flushed angrily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I said we had technicians. Some of them made a gadget to help take\r\n",
      "care of the children. That's harmless. But they want to use it to ...\r\n",
      "to spy on older people with it. On us! Invasion of privacy. We don't\r\n",
      "like ... well ... they try to set up psych circuits near our homes.\r\n",
      "They ... think it's fun to ... know what people say and do--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Psych circuits can be useful,\" observed Calhoun, \"or they can be\r\n",
      "pretty monstrous. On the other hand--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No decent man would do it!\" snapped young Walker. \"And no girl would\r\n",
      "have anything to do with anybody--But there are some crazy fools--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You have described,\" said Calhoun dryly, \"a criminal class. Only\r\n",
      "instead of stealing other people's possessions they want to steal their\r\n",
      "sensations. Peeping-Tom stuff, eavesdropping on what other people feel\r\n",
      "about those they care for, as well as what they do and say. In a way\r\n",
      "it's a delinquency problem, isn't it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There can't be a civilization without problems,\" said Walker. \"But\r\n",
      "we're going to--\" He opened a door. \"My wife works with the kids the\r\n",
      "old people dumped on us. This way.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He motioned Calhoun inside the house. It was one of the shelters\r\n",
      "built during the frenzied building program designed to make an\r\n",
      "emergency refuge for the population of a planet. It was the roughest\r\n",
      "of machine-tool constructions. The floors were not finished. The walls\r\n",
      "were not smooth. The equipment showed. But there had been attempts to\r\n",
      "do something about the crudity. Colors had been used to try to make it\r\n",
      "homelike.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When a girl came in from the next room, Calhoun understood completely.\r\n",
      "She was a little younger than her husband, but not much. She regarded\r\n",
      "Calhoun with that anxiety with which a housekeeper always regards an\r\n",
      "unexpected visitor, hoping he will not notice defects. This young\r\n",
      "wife had those feminine instincts which are much older than tradition.\r\n",
      "Obligations and loyalties may be thrown aside, but a housewife's idea\r\n",
      "of her role is unchangeable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This is a Med Service man,\" said Walker briefly, indicating Calhoun.\r\n",
      "\"I told him there was a health problem about some of the children.\" To\r\n",
      "Calhoun he said curtly: \"This is my wife Elsa.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Murgatroyd said \"_Chee!_\" from where he clung to Calhoun's neck. He was\r\n",
      "suddenly reassured. He scrambled down to the floor. Elsa smiled at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's tame!\" she said delightedly. \"Maybe--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun extended his hand. She took it. Murgatroyd, swaggering,\r\n",
      "extended his own black paw. Instead of conflict and hatred, here,\r\n",
      "Murgatroyd seemed to sense an amiable sociability such as he was used\r\n",
      "to. He felt more at home. He began zestfully to act like the human\r\n",
      "being he liked to pretend he was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's delightful!\" said the girl. \"May I show him to Jak?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Young Walker said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Elsa's been helping with the smaller kids. She says there's something\r\n",
      "the matter that she doesn't understand. She has one of the kids here.\r\n",
      "Bring him, Elsa.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"But,\" interposed the older Walker, gruffly, \"he wants it. He thrives\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You didn't expect us to fall into each other's arms after what's\r\n",
      "happened, did you? No! But we are going to try to ignore our ...\r\n",
      "differences as much as we can. We won't forget them, though.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I suspect,\" said Calhoun, \"that they'll be harder to remember than\r\n",
      "you think. You had a culture that split apart. Its pieces were\r\n",
      "incomplete--and a society has to be complete to survive. It isn't a\r\n",
      "human invention. It's something we have an instinct for--as birds have\r\n",
      "an instinct to build nests. When we build a culture according to our\r\n",
      "instincts, we get along. When that's impossible--there's trouble.\" Then\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said the elder Walker. \"You aren't?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun grinned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought I'd be the most unpopular man on this planet,\" he said\r\n",
      "cheerfully. \"And I am. I interfered in everybody's business and nobody\r\n",
      "carried out his plans the way he wanted to. But at least nobody feels\r\n",
      "like he won. You'll be pleased when I lift the quarantine and take\r\n",
      "off, won't you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The older Walker said scornfully:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We're paying no attention to your quarantine! Our fleet's loading up\r\n",
      "our wives on Phaedra, to ferry them here as fast as overdrive will do\r\n",
      "it! D'you think we'd pay any attention to your quarantine?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun grinned again. The younger Walker said painfully:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I suppose you think we should--\" He stopped, and said very carefully:\r\n",
      "\"What you did was for our good, all right, but it hurts us more than it\r\n",
      "does you. In twenty years, maybe, we'll be able to laugh at ourselves.\r\n",
      "Then we'll feel grateful. Now we know what we owe you, but we don't\r\n",
      "like it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And that,\" said Calhoun, \"means that everything is back to normal.\r\n",
      "That's the traditional attitude toward all medical men--owe them a lot\r\n",
      "and hate to pay. I'll sign the quarantine release and take off as soon\r\n",
      "as you give me some rocket fuel, just in case of emergency.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Right away!\" said the two Walkers, in unison.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun snapped his fingers. Murgatroyd swaggered to his side. Calhoun\r\n",
      "took the little _tormal_'s black paw in his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come along, Murgatroyd,\" he said cheerfully. \"You're the only person\r\n",

      "then bring it gently but irresistibly down to ground. Then Calhoun,\r\n",

      "It was not to be expected that anything important would turn up.\r\n",

      "course of commerce, but he would make sure. He might--but it was\r\n",
      "unlikely--learn of some novelty worked out here. In any case, within\r\n",
      "three days he should return to the small Med Ship, the landing grid\r\n",
      "should heave it firmly heavenward to not less than five planetary\r\n",
      "diameters distance, and there release it. And Calhoun and Murgatroyd\r\n",

      "be gathered when and as it was possible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the Med Service was admittedly important. The local Sector\r\n",
      "Headquarters was in the Cetis cluster. It was a sort of interstellar\r\n",
      "clinic, with additions. It gathered and disseminated the results\r\n",
      "of experience in health and medicine among some thousands of\r\n",
      "colony-worlds, and from time to time it made contact with other\r\n",
      "Headquarters carrying on the same work elsewhere. It admittedly\r\n",
      "took fifty years for a new technique in gene-selection to cross the\r\n",
      "so-far-occupied part of the galaxy, but it was a three-year voyage\r\n",
      "in overdrive to cover the same distance direct. And the Med Service\r\n",
      "was worth while. There was no problem of human ecological adjustment\r\n",
      "it had so far been unable to solve, and there were some dozens of\r\n",
      "planets whose human colonies owed their existence to it. There was\r\n",
      "nowhere--nowhere at all--that a Med Ship was not welcomed on its errand\r\n",
      "from Headquarters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There was no answer. Then, suddenly, every sound-producing device in\r\n",
      "the ship abruptly emitted a hoarse and monstrous noise. The lights\r\n",
      "flashed up and circuit-breakers cut them off. The nearby-object horn\r\n",
      "squawked. The hull-temperature warning squealed. The ship's internal\r\n",
      "gravity-field tugged horribly for an instant and went off. Every device\r\n",
      "within the ship designed to notify emergency clanged or shrieked or\r\n",
      "roared or screamed. There was a momentary bedlam.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It lasted for part of a second only. Then everything stopped. There was\r\n",
      "no weight within the ship, and there were no lights, and there was dead\r\n",
      "silence, and Murgatroyd made whimpering sounds in the darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun thought absurdly to himself, \"_According to the book, this is\r\n",
      "an unfavorable chance consequence of something or other._\" But it was\r\n",
      "more than an unfavorable chance occurrence. It was an intentional and\r\n",
      "drastic and possibly a deadly one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Somebody's acting up,\" said Calhoun measuredly, in the blackness.\r\n",
      "\"What's the matter with them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He flipped the screen switch to bring back vision of what was outside.\r\n",
      "The vision screens of a ship are very carefully fused against over-load\r\n",
      "burnouts, because there is nothing in all the cosmos quite as helpless\r\n",
      "and foredoomed as a ship which is blind in the emptiness of space. But\r\n",
      "the screens did not light again. They couldn't. The cutouts hadn't\r\n",
      "worked in time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun's scalp crawled. But as his eyes adjusted, he saw the palely\r\n",
      "fluorescent handles of switches and doors. They hadn't been made\r\n",
      "fluorescent in expectation of an emergency like this, of course, but\r\n",
      "they would help a great deal. He knew what had happened. It couldn't be\r\n",
      "but one thing--a landing-grid field clamped on the fifty-ton Med Ship\r\n",
      "with the power needed to grasp and land a twenty-thousand-ton liner.\r\n",
      "At that strength it would paralyze every instrument and blow every\r\n",
      "cut-off. It could not be accident. The reception of the news of his\r\n",
      "identity, the repeated request that he identify himself, and then the\r\n",
      "demand that he wait--This murderous performance was deliberate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Maybe,\" said Calhoun in the inky-black cabin, \"as a Med Ship our\r\n",
      "arrival is an unfavorable chance consequence of something--or the\r\n",
      "unfavorableness is--and somebody means to keep us from happening. It\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He released himself from the safety belt and dived across the cabin\r\n",
      "in which there was now no weight at all. In the blackness he opened a\r\n",
      "cabinet door. What he did inside was customarily done by a man wearing\r\n",
      "thick insulating gloves, in the landing grid back at Headquarters.\r\n",
      "He threw certain switches which would allow the discharge of the\r\n",
      "power-storage cells which worked the Med Ship's overdrive. Monstrous\r\n",
      "quantities of energy were required to put even a fifty-ton ship\r\n",
      "into overdrive, and monstrous amounts were returned when it came\r\n",
      "out. The power amounted to ounces of pure, raw energy, and as a\r\n",
      "safety-precaution such amounts were normally put into the Duhanne cells\r\n",
      "only just before a Med Ship's launching, and drained out again on its\r\n",
      "return. But now, Calhoun threw switches which made a rather incredible\r\n",
      "amount of power available for dumping into the landing-grid field about\r\n",
      "him--if necessary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He floated back to the control chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ship lurched--violently. It was being moved by the grid field\r\n",
      "without any gentleness at all. Calhoun's hands barely grasped the back\r\n",
      "of his pilot's chair before the jerk came, and it almost tore them\r\n",
      "free. He just missed being flung against the back wall of the cabin by\r\n",
      "the applied acceleration. But he was a long way out from the planet. He\r\n",
      "was at the end of a lever fifty thousand miles long. For that lever to\r\n",
      "be used to shake him too brutally would require special adjustments.\r\n",
      "But somebody was making them. The jerk reversed directions. He was\r\n",
      "flung savagely against the chair to which he'd been clinging. He\r\n",
      "struggled. Another yank, in another direction. Another one still. It\r\n",
      "flung him violently into the chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Behind him, Murgatroyd squealed angrily as he went hurtling across the\r\n",
      "cabin. He grabbed for holding-places with all four paws and his tail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another shake. Calhoun had barely clipped the safety belt fast before\r\n",
      "a furious jolt nearly flung him out of it again to crash against the\r\n",
      "cabin ceiling. Yet another vicious surge of acceleration. He scrabbled\r\n",
      "for the controls. The yanks and plungings of the ship increased\r\n",
      "intolerably. He was nauseated. Once he was thrust so furiously into the\r\n",
      "control chair that he was on the verge of blacking out, and then the\r\n",
      "direction of thrust was changed to the exact opposite so that the blood\r\n",
      "rushing to his head seemed about to explode it. His arms flailed out of\r\n",
      "control. He became dazed. But when his hands were flung against the\r\n",
      "control board, despite their bruising he tried to cling to the control\r\n",
      "knobs, and each time he threw them over. Practically all his circuits\r\n",
      "were blown, but there was one--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His numbing fingers threw it. There was a roar, so fierce that it\r\n",
      "seemed an explosion. He'd reached the switch which made effective the\r\n",
      "discharge-circuit of his Duhanne cells. He'd thrown it. It was designed\r\n",
      "to let the little ship's overdrive power-reserve flow into storage\r\n",
      "at Headquarters on return from duty. Now, though, it poured into the\r\n",
      "landing-grid field outside. It amounted to hundreds of millions of\r\n",
      "kilowatt hours, delivered in the fraction of a second. There was the\r\n",
      "smell of ozone. The sound was like a thunder clap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But abruptly there was a strange and incredible peace. The lights came\r\n",
      "on waveringly as his shaking fingers restored the circuit-breakers.\r\n",
      "Murgatroyd shrilled indignantly, clinging desperately to an instrument\r\n",
      "rack. But the vision screens did not light again. Calhoun swore.\r\n",
      "Swiftly, he threw more circuit-restorers. The nearest-object indicator\r\n",
      "told of the presence of Maris III at forty-odd thousand miles.\r\n",
      "The hull-temperature indicator was up some fifty-six degrees. The\r\n",
      "internal-gravity field came on, faintly, and then built up to normal.\r\n",
      "But the screens would not light. They were permanently dead. Calhoun\r\n",
      "raged for seconds. Then he got hold of himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Chee-chee-chee!_\" chattered Murgatroyd desperately. \"_Chee-chee!_\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Shut up!\" growled Calhoun. \"Some bright lad aground thought up a new\r\n",
      "way to commit murder. Damned near got away with it, too! He figured\r\n",
      "he'd shake us to death like a dog does a rat, only he was using a\r\n",
      "landing-grid field to do it with! Right now, I hope I fried him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it was not likely. Such quantities of power as are used to handle\r\n",
      "twenty-thousand-ton space liners are not controlled direct, but\r\n",
      "by relays. The power Calhoun had flung into the grid field should\r\n",
      "have blown out the grid's transformers with a spectacular display\r\n",
      "of fireworks, but it was hardly probable it had gotten back to the\r\n",
      "individual at the controls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I suspect,\" observed Calhoun vengefully, \"that he'll consider this\r\n",
      "business an unfavorable occurrence! Somebody'll twist his tail, too,\r\n",
      "either for trying what he did or for not getting away with it! Only, as\r\n",
      "a matter of pure precaution--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His expression changed suddenly. He'd been trying not to think of the\r\n",
      "consequences of having no sight of the cosmos outside the ship. Now he\r\n",
      "remembered the electron telescope. It had not been in circuit, so it\r\n",
      "could not have been burned out like his vision screens. He switched it\r\n",
      "on. A star field appeared over his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Chee-chee!_\" cried Murgatroyd hysterically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun glanced at him. The jerking of the ship had shifted the\r\n",
      "instruments in the rack to which Murgatroyd clung. Clipped into place\r\n",
      "though they were, they'd caught Murgatroyd's tail and pinched it\r\n",
      "tightly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll have to wait,\" snapped Calhoun. \"Right now I've got to make us\r\n",
      "look like a successful accident. Otherwise whoever tried to spread us\r\n",
      "all over the cabin walls will try something else!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Med Ship flung through space in whatever direction and at\r\n",
      "whatever velocity it had possessed when the grid field blew. Calhoun\r\n",
      "shifted the electron-telescope field and simultaneously threw on the\r\n",
      "emergency-rocket controls. There was a growling of the pencil-thin,\r\n",
      "high-velocity blasts. There was a surging of the ship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No straight-line stuff,\" Calhoun reminded himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He swung the ship into a dizzy spiral, as if innumerable things had\r\n",
      "been torn or battered loose in the ship and its rockets had come on of\r\n",
      "themselves. Painstakingly, he jettisoned in one explosive burst all\r\n",
      "the stored waste of his journey which could not be disposed of while\r\n",
      "in overdrive. To any space-scanning instrument on the ground, it would\r\n",
      "look like something detonating violently inside the ship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The planet Maris III swung across the electron telescope's field. It\r\n",
      "looked hideously near--but that was the telescope's magnification. Yet\r\n",
      "Calhoun sweated. He looked at the nearest-object dial for reassurance.\r\n",
      "The planet was nearer by a thousand miles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hah!\" said Calhoun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He changed the ship's spiral course. He changed it again. He abruptly\r\n",
      "reversed the direction of its turn. Adequate training in space-combat\r\n",
      "might have helped plot an evasion-course, but it might have been\r\n",
      "recognizable. Nobody could anticipate his maneuvers now, though. He\r\n",
      "adjusted the telescope next time the planet swept across its field, and\r\n",
      "flipped on the photorecorder. Then he pulled out of the spiral, whirled\r\n",
      "the ship until the city was covered by the telescope, and ran the\r\n",
      "recorder as long as he dared keep a straight course. Then he swooped\r\n",
      "toward the planet in a crazy, twisting fall with erratic intermissions,\r\n",
      "and made a final lunatic dash almost parallel to the planet's surface.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At five hundred miles, he unshielded the ports which of necessity had\r\n",
      "to be kept covered in clear space. There was a sky which was vividly\r\n",
      "bright with stars. There was a vast blackness off to starboard which\r\n",
      "was the night side of the planet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went down. At four hundred miles the outside pressure indicator\r\n",
      "wavered away from its pin. He used it like a pitot-tube recording,\r\n",
      "doing sums in his head to figure the static pressure that should exist\r\n",
      "at this height, to compare with the dynamic pressure produced by his\r\n",
      "velocity through the near hard vacuum. The pressure should have been\r\n",
      "substantially zero. He swung the ship end-for-end and killed velocity\r\n",
      "to bring the pressure-indication down. The ship descended. Two hundred\r\n",
      "miles. He saw the thin bright line of sunshine at the limb of the\r\n",
      "planet. Down to one hundred. He cut the rockets and let the ship fall\r\n",
      "silently, swinging it nose up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At ten miles he listened for man-made radiation. There was nothing in\r\n",
      "the electromagnetic spectrum but the crackling of static in an electric\r\n",
      "storm which might be a thousand miles away. At five miles height the\r\n",
      "nearest-object indicator, near the bottom of its scale, wavered in a\r\n",
      "fashion to prove that he was still moving laterally across mountainous\r\n",
      "country. He swung the ship and killed that velocity, too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At two miles he used the rockets for deceleration. The pencil-thin\r\n",
      "flame reached down for an incredible distance. By naked-eye observation\r\n",
      "out a port he tilted the fiercely-roaring, swiftly-falling ship until\r\n",
      "hillsides and forests underneath him ceased to move. By that time he\r\n",
      "was very low indeed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He reached ground on a mountainside which was lighted by the blue-white\r\n",
      "flame of the rocket-blast. He chose an area in which the tree tops were\r\n",
      "almost flat, indicating something like a plateau underneath. Murgatroyd\r\n",
      "was practically frantic by this time because of his capture and the\r\n",
      "pinching of his tail, but Calhoun could not spare time to release\r\n",
      "him. He let the ship down gently, gently, trying to descend in an\r\n",
      "absolutely vertical line.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If he didn't do it perfectly, he came very close. The ship settled\r\n",
      "into what was practically a burned-away tunnel among monstrous trees.\r\n",
      "The high-velocity slender flame did not splash when it reached ground.\r\n",
      "It penetrated. It burned a hole for itself through humus and clay\r\n",
      "and bedrock. When the ship touched and settled, there was boiling\r\n",
      "molten stone some sixty feet underground, but there was a small\r\n",
      "scratching sound as it came to rest. A flame-amputated tree-limb rubbed\r\n",
      "tentatively against the hull.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun turned off the rockets. The ship swayed slightly and there were\r\n",
      "crunching noises. Then it was still on its landing fins.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now,\" said Calhoun, \"I can take care of you, Murgatroyd.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He flicked on the switches of the exterior microphones--much more\r\n",
      "sensitive than human ears. The radiation-detectors were still in\r\n",
      "action. They reported only the cracklings of the distant storm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the microphones brought in the moaning of wind over nearby\r\n",
      "mountaintops, and the almost deafening susurrus of rustling leaves.\r\n",
      "Underneath these noises there was a bedlam of other natural sounds.\r\n",
      "There were chirpings and hootings and squeaks, and the gruntings made\r\n",
      "by native animal life. These sounds had a singularly peaceful quality.\r\n",
      "When Calhoun toned them down to be no more than background-noises, they\r\n",
      "suggested the sort of concert of night-creatures which to men has\r\n",
      "always seemed an indication of purest tranquility.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently Calhoun looked at the pictures the photorecorder had taken\r\n",
      "while the telescope's field swept over the city. It was the colony-city\r\n",
      "reported to have been begun two years before, to receive colonists from\r\n",
      "Dettra Two. It was the city of the landing grid which had tried to\r\n",
      "destroy the Med Ship as a dog kills a rat--by shaking it to fragments,\r\n",
      "some fifty thousand miles in space. It was the city which had made\r\n",
      "Calhoun land with his vision-plates blinded, that had made him pretend\r\n",
      "his ship was internally a wreck: which had drained his power-reserves\r\n",
      "of some hundreds of millions of kilowatt hours of energy. It was the\r\n",
      "city which had made his return to Med Headquarters impossible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He inspected the telescopic pictures. They were very clear. They showed\r\n",
      "the city with astonishing detail. There was a lacy pattern of highways,\r\n",
      "with their medallions of multiple-dwelling units. There were the lavish\r\n",
      "park areas between the buildings of this planetary capital. There was\r\n",
      "the landing grid itself--a half-mile-high structure of steel girders, a\r\n",
      "full mile in diameter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there were no vehicles on the highways. There were no specks on the\r\n",
      "crossing bridges to indicate people on foot. There were no copters on\r\n",
      "the building roofs, nor were there objects in mid-air to tell of air\r\n",
      "traffic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The city was either deserted or it had never been occupied. But it was\r\n",
      "absolutely intact. The structures were perfect. There was no indication\r\n",
      "of past panic or disaster, and even the highways had not been overgrown\r\n",
      "by vegetation. But it was empty--or else it was dead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "mid-morning of the day after Calhoun's landing. By the time the sound\r\n",
      "reached the ground, of course, the rocket itself was far below the\r\n",
      "horizon; but Calhoun saw the faint white trail of its passage against\r\n",
      "the blue of the sky. The fact that he saw it, in daytime, was proof\r\n",
      "that it was within the atmosphere. Which, in turn, said that the rocket\r\n",

      "Med Ship should have made in an uncontrolled landing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "silence of the radio spectrum said that it wasn't. The absence of\r\n",

      "prevent an inspection unless there was a situation aground that the Med\r\n",
      "Service ought to know about. But there should not possibly be such a\r\n",
      "situation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no logical explanation for such a series of contradictions.\r\n",
      "Civilized men acted this way or that. There could only be civilized men\r\n",

      "shut off all other operating circuits so the ship couldn't be found by\r\n",
      "their radiation. He equipped himself for travel, and he and Murgatroyd\r\n",
      "left the ship. Obviously, he headed toward the city where whatever was\r\n",
      "wrong was centered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Travel on foot was unaccustomed, but not difficult. The vegetation\r\n",
      "was semi-familiar. Maris III was an Earth-type planet and circled a\r\n",
      "Sol-type sun, and given similar conditions of gravity, air, sunlight,\r\n",
      "and temperature-range, similar organisms should develop. There would\r\n",
      "be room, for example, for low-growing ground-cover plants and there\r\n",
      "would also be advantages to height. There would be some equivalent of\r\n",
      "grasses, and there would be the equivalent of trees, with intermediate\r\n",
      "forms having in-between habits of growth. Similar reasoning would apply\r\n",
      "to animal life. There would be parallel ecological niches for animals\r\n",
      "to fill, and animals would adapt to fill them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maris III was not, then, an \"unearthly\" environment. It was much\r\n",
      "more like an unfamiliar part of a known planet than a new world\r\n",
      "altogether. But there were some oddities. An herbivorous creature\r\n",
      "without legs which squirmed like a snake. It lived in holes. A\r\n",
      "pigeon-sized creature whose wings were modified, gossamer-thin scales\r\n",
      "with iridescent colorings. There were creatures which seemed to live\r\n",
      "in lunatic association, and Calhoun was irritably curious to know if\r\n",
      "they were really symbiotes or only unrecognizable forms of the same\r\n",
      "organism, like the terrestrial male and female firefly-glowworm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But he was heading for the city. He couldn't spare time to biologize.\r\n",
      "On his first day's journey he looked for food to save the rations he\r\n",
      "carried. Murgatroyd was handy, here. The little _tormal_ had his place\r\n",
      "in human society. He was friendly, and he was passionately imitative\r\n",
      "of human beings, and he had a definite psychology of his own. But he\r\n",
      "was useful, too. When Calhoun strode through the forests which had\r\n",
      "such curiously un-leaflike foliage, Murgatroyd strode grandly with\r\n",
      "him, imitating his walk. From time to time he dropped to all four paws\r\n",
      "to investigate something. He invariably caught up with Calhoun within\r\n",
      "seconds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once Calhoun saw him interestedly bite a tiny bit out of a most\r\n",
      "unpromising looking shrub-stalk. He savored its flavor, and then\r\n",
      "swallowed it. Calhoun took note of the plant and cut off a section. He\r\n",
      "bound it to the skin of his arm up near the elbow. Hours later there\r\n",
      "was no allergic reaction, so he tasted it. It was almost familiar.\r\n",
      "It had the flavor of a bracken-shoot, mingled with a fruity taste.\r\n",
      "It would be a green bulk-food like spinach or asparagus, filling but\r\n",
      "without much substance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Later, Murgatroyd carefully examined a luscious-seeming fruit which\r\n",
      "grew low enough for him to pluck. He sniffed it closely and drew\r\n",
      "back. Calhoun noted that plant, too. Murgatroyd's tribe was bred\r\n",
      "at Headquarters for some highly valuable qualities. One was a very\r\n",
      "sensitive stomach--but it was only one. Murgatroyd's metabolism was\r\n",
      "very close to man's. If he ate something and it didn't disagree with\r\n",
      "him, it was very likely safe for a man to eat it, too. If he rejected\r\n",
      "something, it probably wasn't. But his real value was much more\r\n",
      "important than the tasting of questionable foods.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Calhoun camped the first night, he made a fire of a plant shaped\r\n",
      "like a cactus-barrel and permeated with oil. By heaping dirt around it,\r\n",
      "he confined its burning to a round space very much like the direct-heat\r\n",
      "element of an electronic stove. It was an odd illustration of the fact\r\n",
      "that human progress does not involve anything really new in kind,\r\n",
      "but only increased convenience and availability of highly primitive\r\n",
      "comforts. By the light of that circular bonfire, Calhoun actually read\r\n",
      "a little. But the light was inadequate. Presently he yawned. One did\r\n",
      "not get very far in the Med Service without knowing probability in\r\n",
      "human conduct. It enabled one to check on the accuracy of statements\r\n",
      "made, whether by patients or officials, to a Med Ship man. Today,\r\n",
      "though, he'd traveled a long way on foot. He glanced at Murgatroyd, who\r\n",
      "was gravely pretending to read from a singularly straight-edged leaf.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Murgatroyd,\" said Calhoun, \"it is likely that you will interpret any\r\n",
      "strange sound as a possible undesirable subjective experience. Which\r\n",
      "is to say, as dangerous. So if you hear anything sizable coming close\r\n",
      "during the night, I hope you'll squeal. Thank you.\"\r\n",

      "field. It had been cleared and planted, of course, in preparation\r\n",
      "for the colonists who'd been expected to occupy the city. Familiar\r\n",
      "Earth-plants grew in it, ten feet high and more. And Calhoun examined\r\n",
      "it carefully, in the hope of finding how long since it had received\r\n",
      "attention. In his examination, he found the dead man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a corpse, the man was brand-new, and Calhoun very carefully put\r\n",
      "himself into a strictly medical frame of mind before he bent over for\r\n",
      "a technical estimate of what had happened, and when. The dead man\r\n",
      "seemed to have died of hunger. He was terribly emaciated, and he didn't\r\n",
      "belong in a cultivated field far from the city. By his garments he was\r\n",
      "a city-dweller and a prosperous one. He wore the jewels which nowadays\r\n",
      "indicated a man's profession and status in it much more than the\r\n",
      "value of his possessions. There was money in his pockets, and writing\r\n",
      "materials, a wallet with pictures and identification, and the normal\r\n",
      "oddments a man would carry. He'd been a civil servant. And he shouldn't\r\n",
      "have died of starvation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He especially shouldn't have gone hungry here! The sweet-maize plants\r\n",
      "were tall and green. Their ears were ripe. He hadn't gone hungry! There\r\n",
      "were the inedible remains of at least two dozen sweet-maize ears.\r\n",
      "They had been eaten some time--some days--ago, and one had been left\r\n",
      "unfinished. If the dead man had eaten them but was unable to digest\r\n",
      "them, his belly should have been swollen with undigested food. It\r\n",
      "wasn't. He'd eaten and digested and still had died, at least largely of\r\n",
      "inanition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun scowled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How about this corn, Murgatroyd?\" he demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He reached up and broke off a half-yard-long ear. He stripped away\r\n",
      "the protecting, stringy leaves. The soft grains underneath looked\r\n",
      "appetizing. They smelled like good fresh food. Calhoun offered the ear\r\n",
      "to Murgatroyd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The little _tormal_ took it in his paws and on the instant was eating\r\n",
      "it with gusto.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you keep it down, he didn't die of eating it,\" said Calhoun,\r\n",
      "frowning, \"and if he ate it--which he did--he didn't die of starvation.\r\n",
      "Which he did.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He waited. Murgatroyd consumed every grain upon the oversized cob. His\r\n",
      "furry belly distended a little. Calhoun offered him a second ear. He\r\n",
      "set to work on that, too, with self-evident enjoyment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In all history,\" said Calhoun, \"nobody's ever been able to\r\n",
      "poison one of you _tormals_ because your digestive system has a\r\n",
      "qualitative-analysis unit in it that yells bloody murder if anything's\r\n",
      "likely to disagree with you. As a probability of _tormal_ reaction,\r\n",
      "you'd have been nauseated before now if that stuff wasn't good to eat.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Murgatroyd ate until he was distinctly pot-bellied. He left a few\r\n",
      "grains on the second ear with obvious regret. He put it down carefully\r\n",
      "on the ground. He shifted his left-hand whiskers with his paw and\r\n",
      "elaborately licked them clean. He did the same to the whiskers on the\r\n",
      "right-hand side of his mouth. He said comfortably:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Chee!_\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then that's that,\" Calhoun told him. \"This man didn't die of\r\n",
      "starvation. I'm getting queasy!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had his lab kit in his shoulder-pack, of course. It was an\r\n",
      "absurdly small outfit, with almost microscopic instruments. But in\r\n",
      "Med Ship field work the techniques of microanalysis were standard.\r\n",
      "Distastefully, Calhoun took the tiny tissue-sample from which he could\r\n",
      "gather necessary information. Standing, he ran through the analytic\r\n",
      "process that seemed called for. When he finished, he buried the dead\r\n",
      "man as well as he could and started off in the direction of the city\r\n",
      "again. He scowled as he walked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He journeyed for nearly half an hour before he spoke. Murgatroyd\r\n",
      "accompanied him on all fours, now, because of his heavy meal. After a\r\n",
      "mile and a half, Calhoun stopped and said grimly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let's check you over, Murgatroyd.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He verified the _tormal's_ pulse and respiration and temperature. He\r\n",
      "put a tiny breath-sample through the part of the lab kit which read off\r\n",
      "a basic metabolism rate. The small animal was quite accustomed to the\r\n",
      "process. He submitted blandly. The result of the checkover was that\r\n",
      "Murgatroyd the _tormal_ was perfectly normal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But,\" said Calhoun angrily, \"that man died of starvation! There was\r\n",
      "practically no fat in that tissue-sample at all! He arrived where\r\n",
      "we found him while he was strong enough to eat, and he stayed where\r\n",
      "there was good food, and he ate it, and he digested it, and he died of\r\n",
      "starvation! Why?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Murgatroyd wriggled unhappily, because Calhoun's tone was accusing. He\r\n",
      "said, \"_Chee!_\" in a subdued tone of voice. He looked pleadingly up at\r\n",
      "Calhoun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm not angry with you,\" Calhoun told him, \"but dammit--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He packed the lab kit back into his pack, which contained food for the\r\n",
      "two of them for about a week.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come along!\" he said bitterly. He started off. Ten minutes later he\r\n",
      "stopped. \"What I said was impossible. But it happened, so it mustn't\r\n",
      "have been what I said. I must have stated it wrongly. He could eat,\r\n",
      "because he did. He did eat, because of the cobs left. He did digest it.\r\n",
      "So why did he die of starvation? Did he stop eating?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun grunted and marched on once more. The man had not died of a\r\n",
      "disease--not directly. The tissue analysis gave a picture of death\r\n",
      "which denied that it came of any organ ceasing to function. Was it\r\n",
      "the failure of the organism--the man--to take the action required for\r\n",
      "living? Had he stopped eating?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun's mind skirted the notion warily. It was not plausible. The man\r\n",
      "had been able to feed himself and had done so. Anything which came upon\r\n",
      "him and made him unable to feed himself--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He was a city man,\" growled Calhoun. \"And this is a long way from the\r\n",
      "city. What was he doing away out here, anyhow?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He hesitated and tramped on again. A city man found starved in a remote\r\n",
      "place might have become lost, somehow. But if this man was lost, he was\r\n",
      "assuredly not without food.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If there was a ground-car,\" Calhoun considered, \"it wouldn't mean\r\n",
      "anything. If he dared go back to the city he might have used it, but he\r\n",
      "wouldn't have been where I found him if he hadn't wanted or needed to\r\n",
      "leave the city. Hm-m-m--He walked out into the middle of the field. He\r\n",
      "was hungry--why didn't he have food?--and he ate. He stayed there for\r\n",
      "days, judging by the amount of food he ate _and_ digested. Why did he\r\n",
      "do that? Then he stopped eating and died. Again why?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He crossed over the top of a rounded hillock some three miles from the\r\n",
      "shallow grave he'd made. He began to accept the idea that the dead man\r\n",
      "had stopped eating, for some reason, as the only possible explanation.\r\n",
      "But that didn't make it plausible. He saw another ridge of higher hills\r\n",
      "ahead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In another hour he came to the crest of that farther range. It was the\r\n",
      "worn-down remnant of a very ancient mountain-range, now eroded to a\r\n",
      "mere fifteen hundred or two thousand feet. He stopped at the very top.\r\n",
      "Here was a time and place to look and take note of what he saw. The\r\n",
      "ground stretched away in gently rolling fashion for very many miles,\r\n",
      "and there was the blue blink of sea at the horizon. A little to the\r\n",
      "left he saw shining white. He grunted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was the city of Maris III, which had been built to receive\r\n",
      "colonists from Dettra and relieve the population-pressure there. It\r\n",
      "had been planned as the nucleus of a splendid, spacious, civilized\r\n",
      "world-nation to be added to the number of human-occupied worlds. From\r\n",
      "its beginning it should hold a population in the hundreds of thousands.\r\n",
      "It was surrounded by cultivated fields, and the air above it should be\r\n",
      "a-shimmer with flying things belonging to its inhabitants.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun stared at it through his binoculars. They could not make an\r\n",
      "image, even so near, to compare to that the electron telescope had\r\n",
      "made from space, but he could see much. The city was perfect. It was\r\n",
      "intact. It was new. But there was no sign of occupancy anywhere in it.\r\n",
      "It did not look dead, so much as frozen. There were no fliers above it.\r\n",
      "There was no motion on the highways. He saw one straight road which\r\n",
      "ran directly away along his line of sight. Had there been vehicles on\r\n",
      "it, he would have seen at least shifting patches of color as clots of\r\n",
      "traffic moved together. There were none.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He pressed his lips together. He began to inspect the nearer terrain.\r\n",
      "He saw foreshortened areas where square miles of ground had been\r\n",
      "cleared and planted to Earth vegetation. The ground would have been\r\n",
      "bulldozed clean, and then great sterilizers would have lumbered back\r\n",
      "and forth, killing every native seed and root and even the native\r\n",
      "soil-bacteria. Then there would have been spraying with cultures of\r\n",
      "the nitrogen-fixing and phosphorous-releasing microscopic organisms\r\n",
      "which normally lived in symbiosis with Earth-plants. They would have\r\n",
      "been tested beforehand for their ability to compete with indigenous\r\n",
      "bacterial life. And then Earth-plants would have been seeded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had been. Calhoun saw that inimitable green which a man somehow\r\n",
      "always recognizes. It is the green of plants whose ancestors throve on\r\n",
      "Earth and have followed that old planet's children halfway across the\r\n",
      "galaxy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The population must be practically nothing,\" growled Calhoun,\r\n",
      "\"because it doesn't show. But the part of it in the city wants to keep\r\n",
      "whatever's happened from the Med Service. Hm-m-m. They're not dying, or\r\n",
      "they'd want help. But at least one dead man wasn't in the city where he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He stared with knitted brows over the vast expanse toward the horizon.\r\n",
      "Murgatroyd had halted a little behind him. He stood up on his hind legs\r\n",
      "and stared intently off to one side. He shaded his eyes with a forepaw\r\n",
      "in a singularly humanlike fashion and looked inquisitively at something\r\n",
      "he saw. But Calhoun did not notice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "So whatever's the matter, it's not fatal to them. There may be people\r\n",
      "wandering about like that poor devil we found. Something was fatal to\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "would-be murderer's state of health.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not good. There was already marked emaciation. The desperately\r\n",

      "physical symptoms, but those afflicted with it tended to be listless\r\n",
      "and lackadaisical and without energy. The first-noticed symptom was\r\n",
      "a cessation of gripes and quarrelings among the workmen. Shortness\r\n",
      "of breath appeared two days later. It was progressive. Deaths\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Plague-stricken or merely terrified people--in pairs or trios widely\r\n",
      "separated through the city--communicated in swift desperation. It was\r\n",
      "possible that there had been a mistake--a blunder; an unauthorized\r\n",
      "crime had been committed. But it was not a mistake. Unthinkable as such\r\n",

      "more violent effort needed to pay attention, and the discovery of\r\n",
      "weakness when one tried to act. One did not feel discomfort--not even\r\n",

      "become aware of the need to do anything at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "an altitude without oxygen. They were even more like those of a man\r\n",
      "in a non-pressurized flier whose oxygen supply has been cut off. But\r\n",
      "such a man would pass out without realizing that he was slipping into\r\n",

      "profession to combat death and illness in all its forms. He took his\r\n",
      "profession seriously. And there are defeats, of course, which a medical\r\n",
      "man has to accept, though unwillingly. But nobody in the profession,\r\n",
      "and least of all a Med Ship man, could fail to be roused to fury by the\r\n",
      "sight of people who should have been his patients, lying utterly still\r\n",

      "of sight for a while or your friends will mistake me for him. I count\r\n",

      "please.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She bared her rather pitifully thin arm. He gave her practically a\r\n",
      "CC of fluid which--plus blood-corpuscles and some forty-odd other\r\n",
      "essential substances--had been circulating in Murgatroyd's blood stream\r\n",
      "not long since. The blood-corpuscles had been clumped and removed by\r\n",

      "most of the others. In a matter of minutes, the lab kit had prepared as\r\n",
      "usable a serum as any animal-using technique would produce. Logically,\r\n",
      "the antibodies it contained should be isolated and their chemical\r\n",
      "structure determined. They should be synthesized, and the synthetic\r\n",
      "antibody-complex administered to plague-victims. But Calhoun faced a\r\n",
      "small group of people doomed to die. He could only use his field kit\r\n",

      "And Calhoun briskly gave them, one after another, the shots of what\r\n",
      "ought to be a curative serum for an unidentified disease which he\r\n",
      "suspected was not caused by any single germ, but by a partnership.\r\n",
      "Synergy is an acting-together. Charcoal will burn quietly. Liquid\r\n",
      "air will not burn at all. But the two together constitute a violent\r\n",
      "explosive. This is analogous to synergy. The ancient simple drug sulfa\r\n",
      "is not intoxicating. A glass of wine is not intoxicating. But the two\r\n",
      "together have the kick of dynamite. Synergy, in medicine, is a process\r\n",
      "in which when one substance with one effect is given in combination\r\n",

      "feel better--perhaps cured of the plague and only weak from failure\r\n",
      "to force yourselves to take nourishment. If it turns out that way,\r\n",
      "I advise you all to get as far away from the city as possible for a\r\n",
      "considerable while. I think this planet is going to be repopulated. I\r\n",
      "suspect that shiploads of colonists are on the way here now--but not\r\n",

      "one seemed half-starved, yet their eyes had not the brightness of\r\n",
      "suffering. They looked weary beyond belief, and yet there was not\r\n",
      "self-neglect. They were of that singular human type which maintains\r\n",
      "human civilization against the inertia of the race--because it drives\r\n",
      "itself to get needed things done. It is not glamorous, this dogged part\r\n",
      "of mankind which keeps things going. It is sometimes absurd. For dying\r\n",
      "folk to wash themselves, when even such exertion calls for enormous\r\n",
      "resolution, is not exactly rational. To help each other try to die with\r\n",
      "dignity was much more a matter of self-respect than of intellectual\r\n",
      "decision. But as a Med Ship man, Calhoun viewed them with some warmth.\r\n",
      "They were the type that has to be called on when an emergency occurs\r\n",

      "of a population inclines to riot or loot or worse.\r\n",

      "leprosy by executing all the people who had it. Lepers were a nuisance.\r\n",
      "They couldn't work. They had to be fed by charity. They died in\r\n",
      "inconvenient places and only other lepers dared handle their bodies.\r\n",
      "They tended to throw normal human life out of kilter. That wasn't the\r\n",
      "case here. The man I killed wanted you dead for another reason. He\r\n",
      "wanted you dead right away.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Nonsense!\" snapped Calhoun. \"The city's infected. You lived, ate,\r\n",
      "breathed, walked in it. Nobody can dare use that city unless they know\r\n",
      "how the contagion's transmitted, and how to counteract it. Your own\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"If the plague is an intended crime,\" added Calhoun, \"you are the\r\n",
      "witnesses to it. You've got to be gotten rid of before colonists from\r\n",

      "\"Monstrous! Monstrous!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Agreed,\" said Calhoun. \"But there's no interstellar government, now,\r\n",
      "any more than there was a planetary government in the old days back on\r\n",
      "Earth. So if somebody pirates a colony ready to be occupied, there's\r\n",
      "no authority able to throw them out. The only recourse would be war.\r\n",
      "And nobody is going to start an interplanetary war! Not with the bombs\r\n",
      "that can be landed! If the invaders can land a population here, they\r\n",
      "can keep it here. It's piracy, with nobody able to do anything to the\r\n",

      "persuaded that they were wrong.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But that was not even worth thinking about. In the computation of\r\n",

      "Children and barbarians have clear ideas of justice due to them, but\r\n",
      "no idea at all of justice due from them. And though human colonies\r\n",
      "spread toward the galaxy's rim, there was still a large part of every\r\n",
      "population which was civilized only in that it could use tools. Most\r\n",
      "people still remained comfortably barbaric or childish in their\r\n",
      "emotional lives. It was a fact that had to be considered in Calhoun's\r\n",
      "profession. It bore remarkably on matters of health.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "in the morning, after I've checked on you people again, I think I'll\r\n",
      "go into the city and see what I can do about it. Try to rest now. You\r\n",
      "should all feel much better in the morning.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You've been exposed to the plague. Have you protected yourself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not yet,\" acknowledged Calhoun. \"Give me a quarter of a CC.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He handed the injector to the gaunt young man. He noted the precision\r\n",
      "with which Kim handled it. Then he helped get the survivors of the\r\n",
      "original group--there were six of them--to the leafy beds under the\r\n",
      "shelters. They were very quiet--even more quiet than their illness\r\n",
      "demanded. They were very polite. The old man and woman who had\r\n",
      "struggled back to the glade together made an especial attempt to bid\r\n",
      "Calhoun good night with the courtesy appropriate to city folk of\r\n",
      "tradition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun settled down to keep watch through the night. Murgatroyd\r\n",
      "snuggled confidingly close to him. There was silence.\r\n",

      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But not complete silence. The night of Maris III was filled with tiny\r\n",
      "noises, and some not so tiny. There were little squeaks which seemed\r\n",
      "to come from all directions, including overhead. There were chirpings\r\n",
      "which were definitely at ground-level. There was a sound like effortful\r\n",
      "grunting somewhere in the direction of the rampart of hills. In the\r\n",
      "lowlands there was a rumbling which moved very slowly from one place to\r\n",
      "another. By its rate of motion, Calhoun guessed that a pack or herd of\r\n",
      "small animals was making a night-journey and uttering deep-bass noises\r\n",
      "as it traveled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He debated certain grim possibilities. The man he'd killed had had\r\n",
      "a ground-car key in his pocket. He'd probably come out in a powered\r\n",
      "vehicle. He might have had a companion, and the method of hunting down\r\n",
      "fugitives--successful, in his case--was probably well established. That\r\n",
      "companion might come looking for him, so watchfulness was necessary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile--the plague. The idea of synergy was still most plausible.\r\n",
      "Suppose the toxins--the poisonous metabolic products--of two separate\r\n",
      "kinds of bacteria combined to lessen the ability of the blood to\r\n",
      "carry oxygen and scavenge away carbon dioxide? It would be extremely\r\n",
      "difficult to identify the pair, and the symptoms would be accounted\r\n",
      "for. No pure culture of any organism to be found would give the\r\n",
      "plague. Each, by itself, would be harmless. Only a combination of two\r\n",
      "would be injurious. And if so much was assumed--why--if the blood\r\n",
      "lost its capacity to carry oxygen, mental listlessness would be the\r\n",
      "first symptom of all. The brain requires a high oxygen-level in its\r\n",
      "blood-supply if it is to work properly. Let a man's brain be gradually,\r\n",
      "slowly, starved of oxygen and all the noted effects would follow.\r\n",
      "His other organs would slow down, but at a lesser rate. He would not\r\n",
      "remember to eat. His blood would still digest food and burn away its\r\n",
      "own fat--though more and more sluggishly--while his brain worked only\r\n",
      "foggily. He would become only semiconscious, and then there would come\r\n",
      "a time of coma when unconsciousness claimed him and his body lived on\r\n",
      "only as an idling machine--until it ran out of fuel and died.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun tried urgently to figure out a synergic combination which\r\n",
      "might make a man's blood cease to do its work. Perhaps only minute\r\n",
      "quantities of the dual poison might be needed--like an antivitamin or\r\n",
      "an antienzyme, or--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The invaders of the city were immune. Quite possibly the same\r\n",
      "antibodies Murgatroyd had produced were responsible for their safety.\r\n",
      "Somewhere, somebody had very horribly used the science of medicine to\r\n",
      "commit a monstrous crime. But the science of medicine--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A savage idea came to Calhoun. Its practicality might depend on the\r\n",
      "number of men in the city. But his eyes burned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He heard a movement across the glade. He reached for his blaster. Then\r\n",
      "he saw where the motion was. It was Kim Walpole, intolerably weary,\r\n",
      "trudging with infinite effort to where Helen Jons lay. Calhoun heard\r\n",

      "conversation was strictly private. But he needed to be on guard. So he\r\n",

      "come looking for him. Did you get his blaster, by the way?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Kim from the darkness across the way.\r\n",

      "action.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll be killed,\" said Kim.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Possibly,\" admitted Calhoun. \"But the number of chance happenings\r\n",
      "that could favor me is very much greater than the number of breaks\r\n",
      "that could favor the invaders. And there's the matter of colonists.\r\n",
      "Prospective colonists. You're being hunted so hard that they must be\r\n",
      "about due. They've probably been immunized against this plague, but\r\n",
      "technically I shouldn't let them land on a plague-stricken planet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kim Walpole stared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You mean you'll try to stop them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall try,\" said Calhoun, \"to implement the authority vested in me\r\n",
      "by the Med Service for such cases as this. The rules about quarantine\r\n",
      "are rather strict.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll be killed,\" said Kim, again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun ignored the repeated prediction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That hunter found you,\" he observed, \"because he knew that you'd have\r\n",
      "to drink. So he found a brook and followed it up, looking for signs of\r\n",
      "humans drinking from it. He found footprints about the spring. I found\r\n",
      "his footprints there, too. That's the trick you'll use to find other\r\n",
      "fugitives. But pass on the word not to leave tracks hereafter. For\r\n",
      "other advice, I advise you to get all the weapons you can. Modern ones,\r\n",
      "of course. You've got the blaster from the man I killed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think,\" said Kim between his teeth, \"that I'll get some more. If\r\n",
      "hunters from the city do track us to our drinking places, I'll know how\r\n",
      "to get more weapons!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" agreed Calhoun, and added, \"Murgatroyd made the antibodies\r\n",
      "that cured you. As a general rule, you can expect antibody production\r\n",
      "in your own bodies once an infection begins to be licked. In case of\r\n",
      "extreme emergency, each of you can probably supply antibodies for a\r\n",
      "fair number of other plague-victims. You might try serum from blisters\r\n",
      "you produce on your skin. Quite often antibodies turn up there. I don't\r\n",
      "guarantee it, but sometimes it works.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He paused. Kim Walpole said harshly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But you! Isn't there anything we can do for you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I was going to ask you something,\" said Calhoun. He produced the\r\n",
      "telephoto films of the city as photographed from space. \"There's a\r\n",
      "laboratory in the city--a biochemistry lab. Show me where to look for\r\n",
      "it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Walpole gave explicit directions, pointing out the spot on the photo.\r\n",
      "Calhoun nodded. Then Kim said fiercely:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But tell us something we can do! We'll be strong, presently! We'll\r\n",
      "have weapons! We'll track down-stream to where hunters leave their\r\n",
      "ground-cars and be equipped with them! We can help you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun nodded approvingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Right. If you see the smoke of a good-sized fire in the city, and if\r\n",
      "you've got a fair number of fairly strong men with you, and if you've\r\n",
      "got ground-cars, you might investigate. But be cagey about it! Very\r\n",
      "cagey!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you signal we'll come,\" said Kim Walpole grimly, \"no matter how few\r\n",
      "we are!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Fine!\" said Calhoun. He had no intention of calling on these weakened,\r\n",
      "starveling people for help.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He swung his depleted pack on his back again and slipped away from the\r\n",
      "glade. He made his way to the spring, which flowed clear and cool from\r\n",
      "unseen depths. He headed down the little brook which flowed away from\r\n",
      "it. Murgatroyd raced along its banks. He hated to get his paws wet.\r\n",
      "Presently, where the underbrush grew thickly close to the water's edge,\r\n",
      "Murgatroyd wailed. \"_Chee! Chee!_\" And Calhoun plucked him from the\r\n",
      "ground and set him on his shoulder. Murgatroyd clung blissfully there\r\n",
      "as Calhoun followed down the stream bed. He adored being carried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two miles down, there was another cultivated field. This one was set\r\n",
      "out to a gigantized root-crop, and Calhoun walked past shoulder-high\r\n",
      "bushes with four-inch blue-and-white flowers. He recognized the\r\n",
      "plants as of the family _solanaceae_--belladona was still used in\r\n",
      "medicine--but he couldn't identify it until he dug up a root and found\r\n",
      "a potato. But the six-pound specimen he uncovered was still too young\r\n",
      "and green to be eaten. Murgatroyd refused to touch it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun was ruefully considering the limitations of specialized\r\n",
      "training when he came to the end of the cultivated field. There was\r\n",
      "a highway. It was new, of course. City, fields, highways and all\r\n",
      "the appurtenances of civilized life had been built on this planet\r\n",
      "before the arrival of the colonists who were to inhabit it. It was\r\n",
      "extraordinary to see such preparations for a population not yet on\r\n",
      "hand. But Calhoun was much more interested in the ground-car he found\r\n",
      "waiting on the highway, hard by a tiny bridge under which the brook he\r\n",
      "followed flowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The key he'd taken from the hunter fitted. He got in and put Murgatroyd\r\n",
      "on the seat beside him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"These invaders, Murgatroyd,\" he observed, \"must be in a bad way. A\r\n",
      "newly-built city which was never occupied will be like an empty house.\r\n",
      "There's no amusement or loot to be found in prowling it. They were\r\n",
      "sent to take over the planet, and they've done it. But they've nothing\r\n",
      "to do now, except hunt refugees--until their colonists arrive. I\r\n",
      "suspect they're bored. We'll try to fix that!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He set the ground-car in motion. Toward the city.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a full twenty miles, but he did not encounter a single other\r\n",
      "vehicle. Presently the city lay spread out before him. He stopped and\r\n",
      "surveyed the vast pile. It was a very beautiful city. Fifty generations\r\n",
      "of architects on many worlds had played with stone and steel, groping\r\n",
      "for the perfect combination of materials with design. This city was a\r\n",
      "product of their tradition. There were towers which glittered whitely,\r\n",
      "and low buildings which seemed to nestle on the vegetation-covered\r\n",
      "ground. There were soaring bridges, and gracefully curving highways,\r\n",
      "and park areas laid out and ready. There was no monotony anywhere.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only exception to gracefulness was the sturdy landing grid itself,\r\n",
      "half a mile high and a mile across, which was a lace-work of massive\r\n",
      "steel girders with spider-thin lines of copper woven about in the\r\n",
      "complex curves the creation of its force-field required. Inside it,\r\n",
      "Calhoun could see the ship of the invaders. It had been brought down\r\n",
      "inside the circular structure and was dwarfed by it. It gleamed there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And we,\" said Calhoun, \"are going to look for a prosaic, probably\r\n",
      "messy laboratory which people who make a sport of hunting\r\n",
      "fellow-humans won't find amusing. Characters like these, Murgatroyd,\r\n",
      "aren't interested in medical science. They consider themselves\r\n",
      "conquerors. People have strange ideas!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Chee!_\" said Murgatroyd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun spread out his photographs. Kim Walpole had marked where he\r\n",
      "should go and a route to it. Having been in the city while it was\r\n",
      "building, he knew even the service-lanes which, being sunken, were not\r\n",
      "a part of the city's good looks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But our enemies,\" explained Calhoun, \"will not deign to use such\r\n",
      "grubby routes. They consider themselves aristocrats because they were\r\n",
      "sent as conquerors, whose job it was to clean up the dead bodies\r\n",
      "of their victims. I wonder what kind of swine are in power in the\r\n",
      "planetary government which sent them?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He put away the photos and headed for the city again. He branched off\r\n",
      "from the rural highway where a turn-off descended into a cut. This\r\n",
      "low-level road was intended for loads of agricultural produce entering\r\n",
      "the city. It was strictly utilitarian. It ran below the surface of the\r\n",
      "park areas and entered the city without pride. It wound between rows of\r\n",
      "service-gates, behind which waste matter was some day to be assembled\r\n",
      "to be carted away for fertilizer on the fields. The city was very well\r\n",
      "designed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rolling along the echoing sunken road, Calhoun saw, just once, a\r\n",
      "ground-car in motion on a far-flung, cobwebby bridge between two tall\r\n",
      "towers. It was high overhead. Nobody in it would be watching grubby\r\n",
      "commerce-roads.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The whole affair was very simple indeed. Calhoun brought the car to a\r\n",
      "stop beneath the overhang of a balconied building many stories high.\r\n",
      "He got out and opened the gate. He drove the car into the cavernous,\r\n",
      "so-far-unused lower part of the building. He closed the gate behind\r\n",
      "him. He was in the center of the city, and his presence was unknown.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He climbed a new-clean flight of steps and came to the sections the\r\n",
      "public would use. There were glassy walls which changed their look as\r\n",
      "one moved between them. There were the lifts. Calhoun did not try to\r\n",
      "use them. He led Murgatroyd up the circular ramps which led upward in\r\n",
      "case of unthinkable emergency. He and Murgatroyd plodded up and up.\r\n",
      "Calhoun kept count.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the fifth level there were signs of use, while all the others had\r\n",
      "that dusty cleanness of a structure which has been completed but not\r\n",
      "yet occupied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here we are,\" said Calhoun cheerfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But he had his blaster in his hand when he opened the door of the\r\n",
      "laboratory. It was empty. He looked approvingly about as he hunted for\r\n",
      "the storeroom. It was a perfectly equipped biological laboratory, and\r\n",
      "it had been in use. Here the few doomed physicians awaiting the city's\r\n",
      "population had worked desperately against the plague. Calhoun saw the\r\n",
      "trays of cultures they'd made--dried up and dead, now. Somebody had\r\n",
      "turned over a chair. Probably when the laboratory was searched by the\r\n",
      "invaders, lest someone not of their kind remained alive in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He found the storeroom. Murgatroyd watched with bright eyes as he\r\n",
      "rummaged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here we have the things men use to cure each other,\" said Calhoun\r\n",
      "oracularly. \"Practically every one a poison save for its special use!\r\n",
      "Here's an assortment of spores--pathogenic organisms, Murgatroyd.\r\n",
      "One could start a plague with them. And here are drugs which are\r\n",
      "synthesized nowadays, but are descended from the compounds found on\r\n",
      "the spears of savages. Great helps in medicine. And here are the\r\n",
      "anaesthetics--poisons, too. These are what I am counting on!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He chose, very painstakingly. Dextrethyl. Polysulfate. The one marked\r\n",
      "inflammable and dangerous. The other with the maximum permissible dose\r\n",
      "on its label, and the name of counteracting substances which would\r\n",
      "neutralize it. He burdened himself. Murgatroyd reached up a paw. Since\r\n",
      "Calhoun was carrying something, he wanted to carry something, too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They went down the circular ramp again. Calhoun searched once more in\r\n",
      "the below-surface levels of the building. He found what he wanted--a\r\n",
      "painter's vortex gun which would throw \"smoke rings\" of tiny\r\n",
      "paint-droplets at a wall or object to be painted. One could vary the\r\n",
      "size of the ring at impact from a bare inch to a three-foot spread.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun cleaned the paint gun. He was meticulous about it. He filled\r\n",
      "its tank with dextrethyl brought down from the laboratory. He piled the\r\n",
      "empty containers out of sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This trick,\" he observed, as he picked up the paint gun again, \"was\r\n",
      "devised to be used on a poor devil of a lunatic who carried a bomb in\r\n",
      "his pocket for protection against imaginary assassins. It would have\r\n",
      "devastated a quarter-mile circle, so he had to be handled gently.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He patted his pockets. He nodded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now we go hunting--with an oversized atomizer loaded with dextrethyl.\r\n",
      "I've polysulfate and an injector to secure each specimen I knock over.\r\n",
      "Not too good, eh? But if I have to use a blaster I'll have failed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked out a window at the sky. It was now late afternoon. He went\r\n",
      "back to the gate to the service road. He went out and piously closed it\r\n",
      "behind him. On foot, with many references to the photomaps, he began to\r\n",
      "find his way toward the landing grid. It ought to be something like the\r\n",
      "center of the invaders' location.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was dark when he climbed other service stairs from the cellar of\r\n",
      "another building. This was the communications center of the city.\r\n",
      "It had been the key to the mopping-up process the invaders began on\r\n",
      "landing. Its call board would show which apartments had communicators\r\n",
      "in use. When such a call showed, a murder-party could be sent to\r\n",
      "take care of the caller. Even after the first night, some individual\r\n",
      "isolated folk might remain--perhaps unaware of what went on. So there\r\n",
      "would be somebody on watch, just in case a dying man called for the\r\n",
      "solace of a human voice while still he lived.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a man on watch. Calhoun saw a lighted room. Paint gun at the\r\n",
      "ready, he moved very silently toward it. Murgatroyd padded faithfully\r\n",
      "behind him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Outside the door, Calhoun adjusted his curious weapon. He entered.\r\n",
      "There was a man nodding in a chair before the lifeless board. When\r\n",
      "Calhoun entered he raised his head and yawned. He turned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun sprayed him with smoke rings--vortex rings. But the rings were\r\n",
      "spinning fissiles of vaporized dextrethyl--that anaesthetic developed\r\n",
      "from ethyl chloride some two hundred years before, and not yet bettered\r\n",
      "for its special uses. One of its properties was that the faintest\r\n",
      "whiff of its odor produced a reflex impulse to gasp. A second property\r\n",
      "was that--like the ancient ethyl chloride--it was the quickest-acting\r\n",
      "anaesthetic known.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man by the call board saw Calhoun. His nostrils caught the odor of\r\n",
      "dextrethyl. He gasped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He fell unconscious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun waited patiently until the dextrethyl was out of the way. It\r\n",
      "was almost unique among vapors in that at room temperature it was\r\n",
      "lighter than air. It rose toward the ceiling. Calhoun moved forward,\r\n",
      "brought out the polysulfate injector, and bent over the unconscious\r\n",
      "man. He did not touch him otherwise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned and walked out of the room with Murgatroyd piously marching\r\n",
      "behind him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Outside, Calhoun said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As one medical man to another, maybe I shouldn't have done that! I\r\n",
      "doubt these invaders have a competent physician among them. But even\r\n",
      "he would be apt to think that that man had collapsed suddenly and\r\n",
      "directly into the coma of the plague. That polysulfate's an assisting\r\n",
      "anaesthetic. It's not used alone, because when you knock a man out with\r\n",
      "it he stays out for days. It's used just below the quantity that would\r\n",
      "affect a man, and then the least whiff of another anaesthetic puts him\r\n",
      "under, and he can be brought out fast and he's better off all around.\r\n",
      "But I've got this man knocked out! He'll stay unconscious for a week.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Murgatroyd piped, \"_Chee!_\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He won't die,\" said Calhoun grimly, \"but he won't come out\r\n",
      "fighting--unless somebody wakes him earlier. And of course, he is a\r\n",
      "murderer!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"_Chee!_\" agreed Murgatroyd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He reached up a furry paw and took hold of Calhoun's hand. They walked\r\n",
      "out into the street together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is notorious that the streets of a city at night are ghostly and\r\n",
      "strange. That is true of a city whose inhabitants are only asleep.\r\n",
      "There is more and worse of eeriness in a deserted city, whose\r\n",
      "inhabitants are dead. But a city which has never lived, which lies\r\n",
      "lifeless under the stars because its people never came to live in\r\n",
      "it--that has the most ghastly feel of all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun and Murgatroyd walked hand in paw through such a place. That\r\n",
      "the invaders felt the same eeriness was presently proved. Calhoun found\r\n",
      "a place where a light shone and voices came out into the tiny, remote\r\n",
      "night sounds of Maris III. Men were drinking in an unnecessarily small\r\n",
      "room, as if crowding together to make up for the loneliness outside. In\r\n",
      "the still night they made a pigmy tumult with their voices. They banged\r\n",
      "drunkenly on a table and on the floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun stood in the doorway and held the paint-gun trigger down. He\r\n",
      "traversed the room twice. Whirling rings of invisible vapor filled the\r\n",
      "place. Men gasped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun waited a long time, because he had put a great deal of\r\n",
      "dextrethyl into a small space. But presently he went in and bent over\r\n",
      "each man in turn, while Murgatroyd watched with bright, inquisitive\r\n",
      "eyes. He arranged one figure so that it seemed to have been stricken\r\n",
      "while bending over another, fallen companion. The others he carried\r\n",
      "out, one at a time, and placed at different distances as if they had\r\n",
      "fallen while fleeing from a plague. One he carried quite a long\r\n",
      "distance, and left him with dusty knees and hands as if he had tried to\r\n",
      "crawl when strength failed him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They'd have been immunized at pretty well the same time, before they\r\n",
      "were shipped on this job,\" Calhoun told Murgatroyd. \"It'll seem very\r\n",
      "plaguelike for them to fall into comas nearly together. If I found\r\n",
      "men like this, and didn't know what to do, I'd suspect that it was a\r\n",
      "delayed-action effect of some common experience--like an immunization\r\n",
      "shot. We'd better try the ship, Murgatroyd.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the way he passed close to the control-building of the landing grid.\r\n",
      "There was a light inside it, too. There were four men on watch. Two\r\n",

      "again to a division and took the left-hand turn, and next time took\r\n",

      "past the car windows, and the tires sang a high-pitched whine, and the\r\n",

      "the smaller park areas of the city.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And as he came from between the stone guard rails of the road, the top\r\n",
      "of the car exploded over his head. He swerved and roared into dense\r\n",
      "shrubbery, jerked Murgatroyd free despite the _tormal's_ clinging fast\r\n",
      "with all four paws and his tail, and dived into the underbrush.\r\n",

      "from his garments and his flesh. They hurt abominably. But the man\r\n",
      "who'd fired wouldn't believe he'd missed, followed as his blasting was\r\n",
      "by the instant wrecking of the car. The man who'd fired would report\r\n",
      "his success before he moved to view the corpse of his supposed victim.\r\n",
      "But there'd be other cars coming. At the moment it was necessary for\r\n",
      "Calhoun to get elsewhere, fast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He heard the rushing sound of arriving cars while he panted and sweated\r\n",
      "through the foliage of the park. He reached the far side and a road,\r\n",
      "and on beyond there was a low stone wall. He knew instantly what it\r\n",
      "was. Service highways ran in cuts, now and again roofed over to hide\r\n",
      "them from sight, but now and again open to the sky for ventilation.\r\n",
      "He'd entered the city by one of them. Here was another. He swung\r\n",
      "himself over the wall and dropped. Murgatroyd recklessly and excitedly\r\n",
      "followed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a long drop, and he was staggered when he landed. He heard a\r\n",
      "soft rushing noise above. A car raced past. Instants later, another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Limping, Calhoun ran to the nearest service-gate. He entered and closed\r\n",
      "it. Scorched and aching, he climbed to the echoing upper stories of\r\n",
      "this building. Presently he looked out. His car had been wrecked in one\r\n",
      "of the smaller park areas of the city. Now there were other cars at\r\n",
      "two-hundred-yard intervals all about it. It was believed that he was\r\n",
      "in the brushwood somewhere. Besides the cars of the cordon, there were\r\n",
      "now twenty men on foot receiving orders from an authoritative figure in\r\n",
      "their midst.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They scattered. Twenty yards apart, they began to move across the park.\r\n",
      "Other men arrived and strengthened the cordon toward which he was\r\n",
      "supposed to be driven. A fly could not have escaped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Those who marched across the park began methodically to burn it to\r\n",
      "ashes before them with their blasters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun watched. Then he remembered something and was appalled. Among\r\n",
      "the fugitives in the glade, Kim Walpole had asked hungrily if they\r\n",
      "whose lives he had saved could not do something to help him. And he'd\r\n",
      "said that if they saw the smoke of a good-sized fire in the city they\r\n",
      "might investigate. He'd had no faintest intention of calling on them.\r\n",
      "But they might see this cloud of smoke and believed he wanted them to\r\n",
      "come and help!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Damn!\" he said wryly to Murgatroyd. \"After all, there's a limit to\r\n",
      "any one series of actions with probable favorable chance consequences.\r\n",
      "I'd better start a new one. We might have whittled them down and made\r\n",
      "the unwhittled ones run away, but I had to start using a car! And then\r\n",
      "they'd try to blame me for everything. So--we start all over with a new\r\n",
      "policy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He explored the building quickly. He prepared his measures. He went\r\n",
      "back to the window from which he'd looked. He cracked its window.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He opened fire with his blaster. The range was long, but with the beam\r\n",
      "cut down to minimum spread he'd knocked over a satisfying number of the\r\n",
      "men below before they swarmed toward the building, sending before them\r\n",
      "a barrage of blaster-fire that shattered the windows and had the stone\r\n",
      "façade smoking furiously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This,\" said Calhoun, \"is an occasion where we have to change their\r\n",
      "advantage in numbers and weapons into an unfavorable circumstance for\r\n",
      "them. They'll be brave because they're many. Let's go!\"\r\n",

      "He met the two ground-car loads of refugees with his arms in the air.\r\n",
      "He did not want to be shot down by mistake. He said hurriedly, when Kim\r\n",
      "and the other lean survivors gathered about him:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Everything's all right. We've a pack of prisoners but we won't\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Hunters,\" said Kim savagely. \"We found them and killed them and took\r\n",
      "their cars. We found some other refugees, too, and I cured them--at\r\n",
      "least they will be cured. When we saw the smoke we started for the\r\n",
      "city. Some of us still have the plague, but we've all had our serum\r\n",
      "shots.\" His face worked. \"When we started for the city, another car\r\n",
      "overtook us. Naturally he wasn't suspicious of a car! We blasted him.\r\n",
      "Half of us have arms, now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't think we need them,\" said Calhoun. \"Our prisoners are quite\r\n",
      "peacefully sleeping. They stormed a building where I'd fired on them,\r\n",
      "and I'd dumped some dextrethyl in the air-conditioning system. They\r\n",
      "keeled over. Later, Murgatroyd and I went in and made their slumber\r\n",
      "more ... ah ... lasting with polysulfate. The few who weren't caught\r\n",
      "were ... ah ... demoralized. I think the city's clean, now. But we've\r\n",
      "got to get to the landing-grid control room. There are some calls\r\n",
      "coming in from space. I think the first shipload of colonists is\r\n",
      "arriving. I didn't answer, so they went in orbit around the planet. I\r\n",
      "want you people to talk to them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We'll bring their ship down,\" said the bearded man hungrily, \"and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Calhoun shook his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To the contrary,\" he said regretfully. \"You'll put on the clothes of\r\n",
      "some of our prisoners. You'll tell the arriving colonists that the\r\n",
      "plague hit you, too. You'll pretend to be one of the characters we\r\n",
      "really have safely sleeping, and you'll say all the rest have been\r\n",
      "bowled over by the plague that was sowed here to win the planet for the\r\n",
      "characters you're talking to. If they land, they'll die--or so you'll\r\n",
      "tell them. And so they will all go home, very unhappy, and they'll tell\r\n",
      "the public about it. And there will be no more shiploads of colonists\r\n",
      "arriving. We don't want them. If we persuade them to go home and not\r\n",
      "come back, there are fewer chances of unfavorable consequences to us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bearded man growled. But later he was one of the most convincing\r\n",
      "of the scarecrow figures whose images appeared in the vision-plates of\r\n",
      "the ship overhead. He was especially pathetic and alarming. When he'd\r\n",
      "finished, there'd have been a mass mutiny of the passengers had the\r\n",
      "spaceship skipper tried to land them.\r\n",
